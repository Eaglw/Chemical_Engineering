It's a theory that describes the force between charged surfaces interacting through a liquid medium. It combines the effect of the [[Soft Matter/van der Walls forces|van der Walls attraction]] and [[Soft Matter/Coulombic forces|electrostatic repulsion]], due to the so called [[Electric Double Layer|double layer of counterions]], by linearly summing them.

$\LARGE w(H)= \frac{32n_{0}kT\pi d \Phi^{2}}{\kappa^{2}}exp\left(-\kappa H\right)-\frac{A_{121}d}{24H}$ 
where:
- $n_{0}$ is the bulk concentration
- d is the particle diameter
- $\Phi$ is the electric potential
- $A$ is the [[Soft Matter/Hamaker theory#^649420|Hamaker constant]] 
- $H$ is the distance between particles
- $\kappa^{-1}$ is the characteristic length of the [[Electric Double Layer|Electric Double Layer]]

### Assumption of the DLVO theory:
1. There is a balance between electrostatic repulsion(EDL) and van der walls attraction. 
2. *Additivity of the two contributions*.
3. Even distribution of particles and ions in the dispersion. 
4. Molecularly smooth and solid interfaces, which are chemically inert except as a source for counterions. 
5. Intervening solvent has bulk properties up to the particle surface. 
6. van der Walls force is obtained by pair wise summation of London dispersion forces and calculated assuming a uniform structure and orientation of the intervening solvent.
### Effect of parameter on the DLVO potential energy
- w(H) depends on particle size $d$, so *electrostatic stabilization is more important the larger the particle is*.

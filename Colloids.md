>Colloids are particles that exhibit [[Brownian motion|Brownian motion]]

Colloids, or colloidal particles, are polyatomic particles suspended in a medium, liquid or gas. The presence of colloids in a fluid can impart some distinctive physical or chemical property to it, or even manifest these relevant properties only in the solid deriving from the the drying of the suspension medium.
The key aspect is that they are *small enough to feel the* [[Thermal motion|thermal agitation]] *of the suspending medium*. 

### Is there a range of length-scale to talk about colloidal particles?
Colloidal particles do not have a fixed length scale, there are no absolute bounds. The colloidal nature of particles is determined by their behavior in relation to gravitational and fluid flow forces, which are *dependent on both the particle and the medium* in which they exist. *In general, particles that exhibit [[Brownian motion|Brownian motion]] are classified as colloidal.*

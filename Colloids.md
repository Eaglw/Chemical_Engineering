Colloids, or colloidal particles, are polyatomic particles suspended in a medium, liquid or gas. The presence of colloids in a fluid can impart some distinctive physical or chemical property to it, or even manifest these relevant properties only in the solid deriving from the the drying of the suspension medium.
The key aspect is that they are *small enough to feel the* [[Thermal motion|thermal agitation]] *of the suspending medium*. 

### Is there a range of length-scale to talk about colloidal particles?
We can't make any restrictions regarding the length scale of colloidal particles, there are no absolute bonds. That's because the colloidal nature of particles depends on how they behave respect to intertial or body forces, such as gravity and fluid flow, so it *depends on both the particles and the medium*.
In general, we can say that particles that particles that go under the [[Brownian motion|Brownian motion]] are considered colloidal.

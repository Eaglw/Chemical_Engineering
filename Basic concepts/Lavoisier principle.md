The Lavoisier principle, also known as the law of conservation of mass, states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction. Instead, it is transformed from one form to another through the process of oxidation-reduction. This means that the total mass of reactants and products in a chemical reaction must always be equal.
In other words, the principle states that the sum of the masses of the reactants must be equal to the sum of the masses of the products. This is because matter cannot be created or destroyed during the process of oxidation-reduction.

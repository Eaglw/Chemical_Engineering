The boundary conditions describe the behaviour of the system on the   
boundaries of the integration domain.
Generally speaking, we need to choose all the boundary conditions so that:
$\nabla \cdot \rho \mathbf{u}_{0}=0$
$\int_{\partial \Omega}\rho\mathbf{u}_{BC}\cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS=0$
In the case of incompressible fluid we can neglect the density contribution.

>$\large \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=D \nabla^{2}C$

where:
- C represents the concentration of the substance at a given point in time t
- D is the diffusion coefficient of the substance
- ∇² denotes the Laplacian operator.
Fick's Law, also known as First Law of Diffusion, describes the movement of substances through a porous medium. The law states that the rate of diffusion of a substance is directly proportional to its concentration gradient and inversely proportional to the square root of the distance traveled.

The Laplacian operator is used to describe the rate of change of the concentration gradient with respect to distance. It measures the curvature of the concentration profile and provides a measure of how quickly the substance diffuses through the medium.

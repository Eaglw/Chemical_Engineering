> $\LARGE \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot \rho \textbf{u}=0$

where:
- $\rho(x,t)$ is the fluid density function  in $kg \cdot m^{-3}$
- $\textbf{u}=(u_{x},u_{y},u_{z})$ is the fluid velocity vector in $m \cdot s^{.1}$ 
- $\nabla \cdot$ is the [[Mathematial tools/Divergence|divergence]] operator in $m^{-1}$

The hypotesis to obtain the *microscopic mass balance* or *continuity equation* are:
1. Homogeneous fluid that moves in the 3D Euclidean space
2. Isothermal condition

## Steady state conditions
If we add the steady state condition hypotesis we can neglect the time derivative.
$\LARGE \nabla \cdot \rho \textbf{u}=0$
## Constant-density fluid
If we consider a *incompressible* fluid, and for pratical purposes any fluid with [[Basic concepts/Mach number]] much lower that 1, we obtain: 
$\LARGE \nabla \cdot \textbf{u}=0$

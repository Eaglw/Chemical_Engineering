>$\LARGE \rho \frac{\partial \textbf{u}}{\partial t} + \rho \textbf{u} \cdot \nabla \textbf{u} = \nabla \cdot \textbf{T}+\textbf{F}$

where:
1. The first term is the momentum accumulation
2. The second term is the convective term, where $nabla$ is the [[Gradient|gradient]] operator in $m^{-1}$
3. The third is the surface force term and **T** is the [[Stress tensor]] in $kg \cdot m^{-1}\cdot s^{-2}$
4. The fourth term is external force term, where **F** is a generic force, like gravity, in $kg \cdot m^{-2}\cdot s^{-2}$

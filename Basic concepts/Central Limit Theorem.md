The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the behavior of large samples from a distribution. It states that, regardless of the shape or skewness of the original distributions, the distribution of sample means will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases. This means that the sample means will become more symmetric and bell-shaped, with most of the values clustered around the mean.

The CLT is based on the idea that the sum of many independent random variables will be approximately normally distributed, even if the individual variables are not.

They are needed because the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Mass balance equation|mass]] and [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Momentum balance equations|momentum]] balance equation form a system of 4 equations in 12 unknowns. 
- mass balance is a scalar equation
- momentum balance is a vectorial equation in 3 components. 
- The unknowns are the velocity vector(3) and the stress tensor(9) components. 
In reality the stress tensor is a symmetric tensor so only 6 unknowns, but we also need to close the system with constitutive equations. 
Constitutive equations relate [[Stress tensor|stress tensor]] components to the quantities already present in the balance equations. 
They depends on the kind of fluids, for example for a [[Basic concepts/Costitutive eq. for Newtornian fluids|newtonian fluid]]

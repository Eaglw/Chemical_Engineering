Balance equations are a core concept in chemical engineering, in fact every transport phenomena goes through the writing of them.
The general structure of balance equations is:
ACC= IN - OUT + GEN 
where:
- ﻿﻿ACC represents accumulation in time of the quantity of interest within a control volume.
- ﻿﻿IN, OUT represent inlet and outlet in time of the quantity of interest through the boundaries of the control volume.
- ﻿﻿GEN represents generation (or disappearance) in time of the quantity of interest within the control volume.

Few examples of balance equations can be [[Basic concepts/Mass balance equation|mass]], [[Basic concepts/Momentum balance equations|momentum]], [[Energy balance equations|energy]] and [[Species transport equations|species transport]] equations.

The "softness" of soft matter is related to the low elastic modulus of this materials. The characteristic that causes this softness is in the microstructure: all amorphous soft materials are characterized by a *microstructural length scale that is way larger than the typical scale of atomic/molecular system*. 
### Reaction to mechanical load, hard vs soft matter
| Load type | Hard matter | Soft matter |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|Low| Elastic linear | Solid-like or fluid-like |
| Large | Elastic non linear | Viscoelastic linear|
| Larger | Plastic irreversible |

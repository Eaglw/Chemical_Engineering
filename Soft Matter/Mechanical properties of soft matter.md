The "softness" of soft matter is related to the low elastic modulus of this materials. The characteristic that causes this softness is in the microstructure: all amorphous soft materials are characterized by a *microstructural length scale that is way larger than the typical scale of atomic/molecular system*. 
### Reaction to mechanical load, hard vs soft matter
Soft matter shows a [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] behavior, it can flow like liquids(with measurable [[Viscosity|viscosity]], and with thinning or thickening behavior) but it can also bear stress in an [[Elasticity|]]
[[Elasticity|elastic]] deformation like solids. 

| Load type | Hard matter | Soft matter |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|Low| Elastic linear | Viscoelastic linear |
| Large | Elastic non linear | Viscoelastic non linear|
| Larger | Plastic irreversible | x |
|Very large | Fracture | x|

Often, colloidal particles are suspended in water. In this case, they accumulate a surface charge and an *electrical double layer* forms around each particle. The overlap between the diffuse layers of two approaching particles results in a repulsive double layer interaction potential, which leads to particle stabilization. When salt is added to the suspension, the electrical double layer repulsion is screened, and [[Soft Matter/van der Walls forces|van der Walls attraction]] become dominant and induce fast aggregation.

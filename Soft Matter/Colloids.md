>Colloids are particles that exhibit [[Soft Matter/Brownian motion|Brownian motion]]

Colloids, or colloidal particles, are polyatomic particles suspended in a medium, liquid or gas. The presence of colloids in a fluid can impart some distinctive physical or chemical property to it, or even manifest these relevant properties only in the solid deriving from the the drying of the suspension medium.
The key aspect is that they are *small enough to feel the* [[Thermal motion|thermal agitation]] *of the suspending medium*. 

### Is there a range of length-scale to talk about colloidal particles?
Colloidal particles do not have a fixed length scale, there are no absolute bounds. The colloidal nature of particles is determined by their behavior in relation to gravitational and fluid flow forces, which are *dependent on both the particle and the medium* in which they exist. *In general, particles that exhibit [[Soft Matter/Brownian motion|Brownian motion]] are classified as colloidal.*

## Colloidal stability
We can divide the systems into:
- *Lyophobic*: thermodynamically unstable (hydrophobic if with water)
- *Lyophilic*: thermodynamically stable (hydrophilic if with water) 

Lyophilic colloids are formed *spontaneously* when the two phases are brought together because the dispersion is thermodynamically more stable than the original separated state.
Instead, lyophobic systems are not formed spontaneously, so in order to create a stable lyophobic colloidal system it's necessary the presence of an *energy barrier*.S The two mechanism that are present regarding the aggregation of particles are [[Thermal motion|thermal agitation]] and all the [[Soft Matter/1. Lessons/3. Interparticle forces|interparticle forces]].
The presence of a barrier implies that the system is under kinetic control rather than thermodynamic control, so they are *metastable systems*.
Lyophobic system can be created with *mechanical energy input*, via some form of agitation

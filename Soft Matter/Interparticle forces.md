There are various interparticle forces that become relevant in the field of [[Soft Matter/Soft matter|Soft matter]].
The fundamental unit of energy in the colloidal and molecular world is given by the [[Soft Matter/Thermal energy|thermal energy]], that is useful to scale all the other forces that can exist in a system.
### Comparison of the modulus of thermal energy, gravity and drag forces, with conseguences
| Particle size | Thermal agitation | Gravity | Drag |
|---| ---|---|---|
|eq.|$k_{b}T/a$|$\frac{4}{3}\pi a^{3} \Delta p$|$6\pi \mu a v$| 
|scaling on a|$\frac{1}{a}$|$a^{3}$|$a$|
|$1 \mu m$ |4fN|4fN|2fN|
|$10 \mu m$|0,4 fN|4000 fN|20 fN|
where $a$ is the characteristic dimension of the particle.
It's easy to understand that the thermal agitation is relevant only on very low scale. For example particles with $a<1 \mu m$ may not sediment because of thermal agitation, instead, larger particles feel gravity much more.
Although there is a more reliable approach
The interactions can be often modelled as a [[Soft Matter/Pair potential|pair potential]], and can be *repulsive* like [[Soft Matter/Hard-core repulsion pair potential|hard-core repulsion]] and [[Soft Matter/Coulombic forces|electrostatic repulsion]], or *attractive*. The attractive ones can be of different natures:
### Which attraction forces can we find within atomic distances?
In the atomic scale we can fine chemical bonds and Lewis acid-based attractions.
### Which attraction forces can we find beyond bond-forming distances?
The most relevants are the [[Soft Matter/Coulombic forces|Coulombic forces]] and the [[Soft Matter/van der Walls forces|van der Walls forces]], with the London(dispersion) forces being the main ones between the van der Walls forces.







### Which is the effect of the presence of the solvent in the interparticle forces?

There are various interparticle forces that become relevant in the field of [[Soft Matter/Soft matter|Soft matter]].
# Force scale respect to thermal energy
The fundamental unit of energy in the colloidal and molecular world is given by the [[Soft Matter/Thermal energy|thermal energy]], that is useful to scale all the other forces that can exist in a system.
### Comparison of the modulus of thermal energy, gravity and drag forces, with conseguences
| Particle size | Thermal agitation | Gravity | Drag |
|---| ---|---|---|
|eq.|$k_{b}T/a$|$\frac{4}{3}\pi a^{3} \Delta p$|$6\pi \mu a v$| 
|scaling on a|$\frac{1}{a}$|$a^{3}$|$a$|
|$1 \mu m$ |4fN|4fN|2fN|
|$10 \mu m$|0,4 fN|4000 fN|20 fN|

where $a$ is the characteristic dimension of the particle.
It's easy to understand that the thermal agitation is relevant only on very low scale. For example particles with $a<1 \mu m$ may not sediment because of thermal agitation, instead, larger particles feel gravity much more.
# Modelling approaches 
There are two approaches to understand the dispersion force attraction between particles and, although the *Lifshitz continuum description* is more reliable, a simpler one is the *molecular model* of the [[Soft Matter/Hamaker theory|Hamaker theory]]. He calculate the total attraction between particles summing the contributions of all pairs of particles.
The interactions can be often modelled as a [[Soft Matter/Pair potential|pair potential]], and can be *repulsive* like [[Soft Matter/Hard-core repulsion pair potential|hard-core repulsion]] and [[Soft Matter/Coulombic forces|electrostatic repulsion]], or *attractive*. The attractive ones can be of different natures.
### Which attraction forces can we find within atomic distances and beyond bond-forming distances?
In the atomic scale we can fine chemical bonds and Lewis acid-based attractions.
Regarding beyond the bond-forming distances, the most relevant are the [[Soft Matter/Coulombic forces|Coulombic forces]] and the [[Soft Matter/van der Walls forces|van der Walls forces]], with the London(dispersion) forces being the main ones between the van der Walls forces.
### Which is the effect of the presence of the *solvent* in the interparticle forces?
Interaction between molecules in a solvent medium can be very different from that of isolated molecules in free space or in a gas.
The presence of a suspending medium does more than simply reduce the interaction energy or force. The intrinsic dipole moment and polarizability of an isolated gas molecule may be different in the liquid state or when dissolved in a medium, in fact, a dissolved molecule can move only by displacing an equal volume of solvent from its path.

# DLVO: EDL repulsion + van der Walls attraction
In complex systems, long-range electrostatic forces are also involved, and their relation with van der Walls forces has many important consequences, like avoiding coagulation of particles. These electrostatic interactions come from the presence of the [[Soft Matter/Electric Double Layer|Electric Double Layer]](EDL), and its interaction with the van der Walls forces is described in the [[Soft Matter/DLVO theory|DLVO theory]].  
# Entropic repulsion and deplation flocculation
Another type of repulsion can be [[Soft Matter/Entropic repulsion|entropic repulsion]], tuned by the addition of polymer chains in the colloidal system. The nature of the added polymer can influence the entropic repulsion, and, as well, promoting the opposite phenomenon, the [[Deplation flocculation|deplation flocculation]]. The two phenomena are always competing and the prevalence on one over the other is tuned by parameters like temperature of pH.

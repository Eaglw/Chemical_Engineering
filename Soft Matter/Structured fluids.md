Condensed matter with atoms freely mobile on a local scale, containing *connected polyatomic structures* like solid grains or large molecules.
### Which is the difference between simple and structured fluids?
- Simple: material with a uniform phase, such as a solution or pure substance.
- Structured: materials which contain more than one phase, such as solid particles dispersed in a liquid, gas particles in foam or an emulsion of immiscible liquids since their rheological behavior is in general dominated by the interactions of the constituents.

### Which attraction forces can we find within atomic distances?
In the atomic scale we can fine chemical bonds and Lewis acid-based attractions.
### Which attraction forces can we find beyond bond-forming distances?
The most relevants are the [[Soft Matter/Coulombic forces|Coulombic forces]] and the [[Soft Matter/van der Walls forces|van der Walls forces]]. 
The latters, can be also divided into more specific categories based on the pair of free and induced dipoles.

The most relevant for particles are the London(dispersion) and the electrostatic forces.

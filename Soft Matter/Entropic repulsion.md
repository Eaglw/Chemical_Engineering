Another type of repulsion can be had with the adsorption of polymeric chains on to the colloidal particles, that form a protective layer around the particle. If two particles try to coalesce for the [[Soft Matter/van der Walls forces|van der Walls forces]], the polymeric layers act as a [[Entropic spring|entropic spring]] and push them back, trying to return to their reference configuration. 
Generally speaking, the surface layer has a thickness equal to the [[Soft Matter/Radius of gyration|radius of gyration]] of the macromolecule(1-10$nm$).

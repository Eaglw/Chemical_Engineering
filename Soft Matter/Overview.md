### Differences between classical and speciality chemicals

^455981

Classical chemicals the first produced by the chemical industry since 60'. They are basic compounds, *commodity chemicals*(ammonia, methanol, sulfuric acid), and they are define by their chemical composition, they are in single phase and simple molecules.
So there is no microstructure in this chemicals.
Otherwise, the speciality chemicals are more complex compounds and with microstructure. In particular, the process(often tailor-made) influence the microstructure, and the microstructure affects the performance of the chemicals.
The goal with classical chemicals was to maximize production and so minimize the price, but for speciality chemicals the main goal is the performance of the products.
Also, speciality chemicals' value is a lot higher than the value of the reagents.

### The continuum hypotesis is always valid?
If we are dealing with a reactor with micro dimentions, this hypotesys may be not valid. If we use macromolecules like polymers, the dimention of the molecule became relevant in a micro scale, so we can't apply the continuum hypotesis.

### Shear vs elongational flow: which one has the biggest deformation?
Talking about colloidal particles in a fluid, every deformation reflects on the particles. 
The deformation of the particles increases the internal tension of the suspension because the particles are no longer in the configuration that minimize surface tension.
The [[deformation tensor]] E is symmetrical in the elongational deformation and is composed by a symmetrical and an antisymmetrical part in the shear deformation. The antisymmetrical part is the rotational part. The rotation is rigid, so only the symmetrical part of the tensor produces an effective deformation. 
That's why the deformation of the colloidal particles is always higher in the case of a elongational deformation.

### Capillarity number
$Ca = \frac{R \dot \gamma \dot \eta}{}

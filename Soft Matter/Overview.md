### Differences between classical and speciality chemicals
Classical chemicals the first produced by the chemical industry since 60'. They are basic compounds, *commodity chemicals*(ammonia, methanol, sulfuric acid), and they are define by their chemical composition, they are in single phase and simple molecules.
So there is no microstructure in this chemicals.
Otherwise, the speciality chemicals are more complex compounds and with microstructure. In particular, the process(often tailor-made) influence the microstructure, and the microstructure affects the performance of the chemicals.
The goal with classical chemicals was to maximize production and so minimize the price, but for speciality chemicals the main goal is the performance of the products.
Also, speciality chemicals' value is a lot higher than the value of the reagents.

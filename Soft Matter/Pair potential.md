The name comes from the fact that the potential is defined from a pair of molecules/particles. The force between the 2 particles can be defined from the [[Gradient|gradient]] of the potential energy.
$\LARGE F=- \frac{\partial w(r)}{\partial r}$ 
Let's analyse some common elements of the pair potentials of different natures starting from the [[Soft Matter/Lennar Jones pair potential|Lennar Jones pair potential]].

Considering one particle in r=0 and the other at r, we can see three distint parts in this graph:
1. *Repulsive force in red*: the potential energy is decreasing, gradient(or derivative in this 2D case) is negative, and the force is positive. This rapid increase in potential energy is related to the [[Soft Matter/Hard-core repulsion pair potential|hard-core repulsion]].
2. *Zero force point in blue*: The curve slope is zero, so zero forces between particles. In this area particles can aggregate. 
3. *Attractive force in green*: The slope is increasing, so the force is negative, attractive.
In other pair potentials we could have two minima in this graph, and we can tune it for different behaviours.

The complete expression for the volumetric flow rate is:
$\large Q=\frac{\pi DN}{2}WH \cos \phi-\frac{WH^{3}}{12 \mu}\frac{\Delta p}{Z}$
$\Delta p= K \mu Q$
The first term is the drag term and the second is the pressure 
where:
- D is the barrel diameter
- N is the RPM
- W is the distance between two flight
- $\phi$ is the angle of the screw
- H is the distances between the inner part of the screw and the barrel
- K is the tortuosity

Dealing with Soft Matter, expecially polimers, it's easy to find extruders in the production processes. An extruder is a device used for the continuous production of various shapes and sizes of materials, such as plastics, metals, and ceramics. It operates by applying pressure to a material, which is then forced through a die or mold to form the desired shape. The process of extrusion involves several stages, including heating, melting, forming, and cooling.

The process starts with solid polymer in granules, fed to the hopper by gravity. This granules advance in the channel formed between the screw and the barrel and begin to bel

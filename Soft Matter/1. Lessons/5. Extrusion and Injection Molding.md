The complete expression for the volumetric flow rate is:
$\large Q=\frac{\pi DN}{2}WH \cos \phi-\frac{WH^{3}}{12 \mu}\frac{\Delta p}{Z}$
$\Delta p= K \mu Q$
The first term is the drag term and the second is the pressure 
where:
- D is the barrel diameter
- N is the RPM
- W is the distance between two flight
- $\phi$ is the angle of the screw
- H is the distances between the inner part of the screw and the barrel
- K is the tortuosity

Dealing with Soft Matter, expecially polimers, it's easy to find extruders in the production processes. An extruder is a device used for the continuous production of various shapes and sizes of materials, such as plastics, metals, and ceramics. It operates by applying pressure to a material, which is then forced through a die or mold to form the desired shape. The process of extrusion involves several stages, including heating, melting, forming, and cooling.
The process starts with solid polymer in granules, fed to the hopper by gravity. This granules advance in the channel formed between the screw and the barrel and begin to melt. The heat can be from an external source or just from the friction of the solid granules moving in the channel. The melt became pressurized moving toward the outlet.

In the realm of soft matter, particularly polymers, extruders are commonly employed in production processes. An extruder is a device that facilitates the continuous production of various shapes and sizes of materials, such as plastics and metals. The operation of an extruder involves applying pressure to a material, which is then forced through a die or mold to form the desired shape.

The process of extrusion encompasses several stages, including heating, melting, forming, and cooling. Initially, solid polymer granules are fed into the hopper by gravity. As these granules progress through the channel formed between the screw and the barrel, they begin to melt due to either external heat sources or the friction generated by their movement in the channel. The melt is pressurized as it moves towards the outlet.Ô∏è

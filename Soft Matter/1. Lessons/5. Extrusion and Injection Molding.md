The complete expression for the volumetric flow rate is:
$\large Q=\frac{\pi DN}{2}WH \cos \phi-\frac{WH^{3}}{12 \mu}\frac{\Delta p}{Z}$
$\Delta p= K \mu Q$
The first term is the drag term and the second is the pressure 
where:
- D is the barrel diameter
- N is the RPM
- W is the distance between two creste(?)
- $\phi$ is the angle of the screw
- H is the distances between the inner part of the screw and the barrel
- K is the tortuosity

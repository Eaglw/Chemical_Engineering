The complete expression for the volumetric flow rate is:
$\large Q=\frac{\pi DN}{2}WH \cos \phi-\frac{WH^{3}}{12 \mu}\frac{\Delta p}{Z}$
$\Delta p= K \mu Q$
The first term is the drag term and the second is the pressure 
where:
- D is the barrel diameter
- N is the RPM
- W is the distance between two flight
- $\phi$ is the angle of the screw
- H is the distances between the inner part of the screw and the barrel
- K is the tortuosity

An extruder is a device used for the continuous production of various shapes and sizes of materials, such as plastics, metals, and ceramics. It operates by applying pressure to a material, which is then forced through a die or mold to form the desired shape. The process of extrusion involves several stages, including heating, melting, forming, and cooling.

The first stage in the extrusion process is heating, where the material is heated to a temperature at which it becomes soft and pliable. The temperature of the material is carefully controlled to ensure that it is not overheated, which can cause it to degrade or become unstable.

Once the material has been heated, it is melted and mixed to form a homogeneous mass. This is typically done using a mixing device such as a twin-screw extruder or a single-screw extruder. The mixing process helps to ensure that the material is evenly distributed and free of air bubbles or other impurities.

The next stage in the extrusion process is forming, where the melted material is forced through a die or mold to form the desired shape. The pressure applied to the material during this stage determines the thickness and strength of the final product. The type of die used also affects the final shape of the product.

Finally, the extruded product is cooled to prevent it from shrinking or warping. This is typically done using a cooling system such as a water bath or an air-cooled conveyor belt. Once the product has been cooled, it can be removed from the die and cut into the desired length and width.

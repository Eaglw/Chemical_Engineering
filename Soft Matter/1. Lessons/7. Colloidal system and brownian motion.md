Colloidal systems analysis is a crucial aspect of [[Soft Matter/Soft matter|Soft matter]] research, and involves the study of [[Soft Matter/Colloids|colloidal particles]], which are microscopic particles suspended in a fluid or gas. The properties of these particles can significantly affect the overall behavior of the system, including its rheological flow.
The main property of colloidal particles is that they exhibit [[Soft Matter/Brownian motion|Brownian motion]].

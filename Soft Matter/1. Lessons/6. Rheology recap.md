If we want to deal with soft matter in flow we must consider all the rheological problems related.

> Rheology is the study of fundamental, constitutive relationships between dynamic quantities (forces, [[Rheology/Stress|stresses]]) and kinematic quantities (deformations, [[Rheology/Strain|strain]], [[Rheology/Strain rate|strain rate]])

The most common constitutive relationships are the elastic solid and the newtonian liquid.

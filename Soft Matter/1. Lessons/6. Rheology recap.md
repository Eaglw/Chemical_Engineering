If we want to deal with soft matter in flow we must consider all the rheological problems related. 
>[! definition]
> Rheology is the study of fundamental, constitutive relationships between dynamic quantities (forces, [[Rheology/Stress|stresses]]) and kinematic quantities (deformations, [[Rheology/Strain|strain]], [[Rheology/Strain rate|strain rate]])

The most common constitutive relationships are the elastic solid and the newtonian liquid.
- Elastic solid: The stresses are directly proportional to the deformation respect to the reference shape of the solid itself.
- Newtonian liquid: the stresses are directly proportional to the strain rate.

These 2 behaviours can be linked throught the concept of memory, or better, time scale.

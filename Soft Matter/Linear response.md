Linear response implies that the *microstructure* of the material *at equilibrium* essentially remains constant in non-equilibrium situation, and is only *infinitesimally* perturbed. 
- The response is *proportional* to some measure of the perturbation. 
- For small deformation we can almost always assume linearity.

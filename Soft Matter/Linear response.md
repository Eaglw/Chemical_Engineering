Linear response implies that the *microstructure* of the material *at equilibrium* essentially remains constant in non-equilibrium situation, and is only *infinitesimally* perturbed. 
- The response is *proportional* to some measure of the perturbation. 
- For small deformation we can almost always assume linearity. 
That is true because in a equilibrium state the [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs free energy]] is in a minimum, and the surroundings of that minimum have always a parabolic shape. 
The force required to displace the material from it's free-energy minimum is the *derivative of the free energy*, and so if the profile is parabolic, the derivative is linear.

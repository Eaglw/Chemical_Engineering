It's a phenomenon that competes with the entropic repulsion in the presence of polymers in the system. 
The presence of free polymers(not adsorbed) can lead to the aggregation of colloidal particles because of the formation of a concentration gradient, if 2 colloidal particle come closer together, that pushes them to aggregate.
It's a relatively weak forces, that can be relevant in the case of high concentration of free polymers, and it acts only if the distances of the particles is lower than the [[Soft Matter/Radius of gyration|radius of gyration]].
If $d<r_{g}$, between the particles there will not be any free polymers, so the osmotic pressure on the external sides becomes higher than the internal one, and that causes the net attraction forces.

Also called *complex liquid*, soft matter is related to the concept of [[Structured fluids|structured fluids]]. 
### Structure of soft matter
The characteristic of soft matter is the presence of suspended particles/droplets, macromolecular coils, and self-assembled structures as micelles and bilayers. 
At least one of the elements must be on a *mesoscopic length scale*, so above the atomic scale(1nm) up to the bulk(1mm). 
### Consequences of the structure of soft matter
There are 2 main consequences of the presence of connected polyatomic structures.
- Large and nonlinear response:  non [[Soft Matter/Linear response|linear response]] that is higher than the force applied
- Characteristic [[Relaxation time|relaxation time]] of simple liquids is near $10^{-9} s$ while the soft matter's one can be $1$ - $10^4$ s.

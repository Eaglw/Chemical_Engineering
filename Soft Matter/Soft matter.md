Also called *complex liquid*, soft matter is related to the concept of [[Soft Matter/Structured fluids|structured fluids]]. 
### Structure of soft matter
The characteristic of soft matter is the presence of suspended particles/droplets, macromolecular coils, and self-assembled structures as micelles and bilayers. 
At least one of the elements must be on a *mesoscopic length scale*, so above the atomic scale(1nm) up to the bulk(1mm).

### Consequences of the structure of soft matter
There are 3 main consequences of the presence of connected polyatomic structures.
- [[Soft Matter/Mechanical properties of soft matter|Mechanical properties of soft matter]] 
- Large and nonlinear response: non [[Rheology/Linear response|linear response]] that is higher than the force applied.
- Higher relaxation times: characteristic [[Relaxation time|relaxation time]] of simple liquids is near $10^{-9} s$ while the soft matter's one can be $1$ - $10^4$ s.

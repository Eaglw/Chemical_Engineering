van der Walls forces are a class of forces between molecules or particles mainly attractive, but also repulsive in a particular case. All van der Waals forces exhibit anisotropy, meaning they depend on the relative orientation of the molecules. When the molecules exhibit [[Thermal motion|thermal motion]], such as when they are in a gaseous or liquid state, the electrostatic force significantly reduces as the molecules continuously rotate.
They can be split into 3 categories. 

Van der Waals forces represent a class of intermolecular forces that encompass both attractive and, in specific cases, repulsive interactions between molecules or particles. These forces exhibit anisotropy, meaning their magnitude depends on the relative orientation of the interacting molecules. In systems where thermal motion, as observed in gaseous or liquid states, is prevalent, the electrostatic force between molecules experiences a significant reduction as the molecules continuously undergo rotational motion.

Van der Waals forces can be categorized into three distinct types:
## London dispersion forces
These forces result from the formation of *temporary dipole* moments in molecules due to fluctuations in electron distribution. Although they are the weaker force in a vacuum, they play a crucial role in interactions between nonpolar molecules, such as methane or noble gases.
## Debye forces
Caused by the interaction between a *permanent dipole* and a *temporary dipole*.
This attractive force occurs when a polar molecule induces a dipole moment in an initially nonpolar molecule. The strength of this attraction is directly proportional to the polarizability of the molecule, which, in turn, is linked to its dimensions.
## Keesom forces 
These forces, also known as dipole-dipole interactions, are attractive forces that occur when *permanent dipoles* (polar molecules) align themselves in such a way that the positive pole of one molecule is oriented towards the negative pole of an adjacent molecule in close proximity.  *Hydrogen bonding* represents an extreme form of these interactions. The average energy of dipole-dipole forces is about 4 kJ/mole, much weaker compared to covalent bonds (around 400 kJ/mole).

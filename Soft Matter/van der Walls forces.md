van der Walls forces are a class of forces between molecules or particles mainly attractive, but also repulsive in a particular case. All van der Waals forces exhibit anisotropy, meaning they depend on the relative orientation of the molecules. When the molecules exhibit [[Thermal motion|thermal motion]], such as when they are in a gaseous or liquid state, the electrostatic force significantly reduces as the molecules continuously rotate.
They can be split into 3 categories. 
## London dispersion forces
Caused by the formation of *temporary dipole* in molecules. In void they are the weaker forces, but they are still the main forces between non polar molecules like methan or noble gas.
## Debye forces
Cause by the interaction between a *permanent dipole* and a *temporary dipole*

## Keesom forces

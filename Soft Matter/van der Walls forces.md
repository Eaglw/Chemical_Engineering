Van der Waals forces represent a class of intermolecular forces that encompass both attractive and, in specific cases, repulsive interactions between molecules or particles. These forces exhibit anisotropy, meaning their magnitude depends on the relative orientation of the interacting molecules. In systems where [[Thermal motion|thermal motion]], as observed in *gaseous or liquid states*, is prevalent, the electrostatic force between molecules experiences a significant reduction as the molecules continuously undergo rotational motion.
# Dipole momentum
To understand the nature of the van der Walls forces is useful to introduce the *Dipole momentum.* It's a measure of the separation of positive and negative electrical charges within a system. 
$\LARGE u= ql \quad [Cm]$ where $\LARGE 1 Debye=1D=3.336*10^{30} Cm$ 
An object with an electric dipole moment is subject to a torque $\tau=u \times E$(for a uniform E in space) when placed in an external electric field.

Van der Waals forces can be categorized into three distinct types:
# London dispersion forces
These forces result from the formation of *temporary dipole* moments in molecules due to fluctuations in electron distribution. Although they are the weaker force in a vacuum, they play a crucial role in interactions between nonpolar molecules, such as methane or noble gases. These dispersion forces are general and omnipresent, like gravity forces, and plays a

# Debye forces
Caused by the interaction between a *permanent dipole* and a *temporary dipole*.
This attractive force occurs when a polar molecule induces a dipole moment in an initially nonpolar molecule. The strength of this attraction is directly proportional to the polarizability of the molecule, which, in turn, is linked to its dimensions.
## Interaction between an ion and uncharged molecule
A molecule of polarizability $\alpha$ at a distance r from an ion of charge $ze$ feels and electric field $E= \frac{ze}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}\epsilon r^{2}}$, that induces a dipole moment:
$\Large u_{i}= \alpha E= \frac{\alpha ze}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}\epsilon r^{2}}$ 
This results in an attractive force between the ion and the molecule.
## Interaction bewteen Polar and Unpolar molecules
Conceptually similar to the previous case, but the polarization is cause by a polar molecule. Generally speaking, this interaction is not strong enough to mutually orient the molecules
# Keesom forces 
These forces, also known as dipole-dipole interactions, are attractive forces that occur when *permanent dipoles* (polar molecules) align themselves in such a way that the positive pole of one molecule is oriented towards the negative pole of an adjacent molecule in close proximity.  *Hydrogen bonding* represents an extreme form of these interactions. The average energy of dipole-dipole forces is about 4 kJ/mole, much weaker compared to covalent bonds (around 400 kJ/mole).

van der Walls forces are a class of forces between molecules or particles mainly attractive, but also repulsive in a particular case. All van der Waals forces exhibit anisotropy, meaning they depend on the relative orientation of the molecules. When the molecules exhibit [[Thermal motion|thermal motion]], such as when they are in a gaseous or liquid state, the electrostatic force significantly reduces as the molecules continuously rotate.

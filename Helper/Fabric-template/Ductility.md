>[!definition]
>It's a characteristic associated to the capacity to deform in the plastic range. 

It can be measured as the [[Helper/Fabric-template/Engineering strain|percentual engineering strain]] at rupture, or as the *percentual section area reduction*:
$\LARGE \frac{A_{0}-A_{l}}{A_{0}}\cdot 100$
where:
- $A_{0}$ is the cross section area before the elongation test
- $A_{l}$ is the cross section area at the breaking point of the test

## Ductility index
$\LARGE \mu=\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta y}$
>![[Helper/media/Ductility.png]]
where:
- $\Delta u$ is the total deformation till rupture, elastic range + plastic range
- $\Delta y$ is the deformation in the elastic range

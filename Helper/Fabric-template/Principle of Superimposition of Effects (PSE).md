The principle of superposition of effects  is a method used in structural analysis to determine the overall response of a linear system under multiple loads. It is based on the idea that the response of a linear system to a combination of loads is equal to the sum of the responses that would have been obtained if each load had been applied separately. The principle can be applied to both static and dynamic loads, and is useful in cases where the structure is subjected to multiple loads that are not easily applied simultaneously. The superposition principle is only applicable to linear systems, and cannot be used in cases where the structure exhibits nonlinear behavior, so in the hypothesis of *small displacements*.

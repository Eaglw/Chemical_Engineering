>$\LARGE \rho c_{P} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \rho c_{P} \textbf{u} \cdot \nabla T = - \nabla \cdot \textbf{q} + \boldsymbol{\sigma} \nabla \textbf{u} - \frac{\partial ln \rho}{\partial ln T} \bigg|_{p} \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}+\textbf{u} \cdot \nabla p \right) + S$

where:
1. The first term is *energy accumulation* term and $c_{p}$ is *specific heat at constant pressure* in $\frac{J}{kg \cdot K}$
2. Second term is the *convective term* and T is *fluid temperature* in K
3. The third is the *conductive term*, where $\textbf{q}$ is the *conductive heat flux* in $\frac{J}{m^{2} s}$
4. The fourth is the *viscous dissipation* term 
5. The fifth is the *variation of energy by compression* term
6. The sixth is the *energy generation* term and S is the *specific generation of thermal energy* in $\frac{J}{m^{3}s}$

The energy balance is a scalar equation.

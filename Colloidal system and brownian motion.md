Colloidal systems analysis is a crucial aspect of [[Soft Matter/Soft matter|Soft matter]] research, and involves the study of [[Colloids|colloidal particles]], which are microscopic particles suspended in a fluid or gas. The properties of these particles can significantly affect the overall behavior of the system, including its rheological flow.
The main property of colloidal particles is that the exhibit [[Brownian motion|Brownian motion]].

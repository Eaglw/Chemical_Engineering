There are various interparticle forces that become relevant in the field of [[Soft Matter/Soft matter|Soft matter]]. 
The fundamental unit of energy in the colloidal and molecular world is given by the [[Thermal energy|thermal energy]], that is useful to scale all the other forces that can exist in a system.
### Comparison of the modulus of thermal energy, gravity and drag forces, with conseguences

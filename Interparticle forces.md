There are various interparticle forces that become relevant in the field of [[Soft Matter/Soft matter|Soft matter]]. 
The fundamental unit of energy in the colloidal and molecular world is given by the [[Thermal energy|thermal energy]], that is useful to scale all the other forces that can exist in a system.
### Comparison of the modulus of thermal energy, gravity and drag forces, with conseguences
| Particle size | Thermal agitation | Gravity | Drag |
|---| ---|---|---|
|eq.|$k_{b}T/a$|$\frac{4}{3}\pi a^{3} \Delta p$|$6\pi \mu a v$| 
|scaling on a|$\frac{1}{a}$|$a^{3}$|$a$|
|$1 \mu m$ |4fN|4fN|2fN|
|$10 \mu m$|0,4 fN|4000 fN|20 fN|

It's easy to understand that the thermal agitation is relevant only on very low scale. For example particles with $a<1 \mu m$ may not sediment because of thermal agitation, instead, larger particles feel gravity much more.

The *repulsive* interaction can be of [[Hard-core repulsion pair potential|hard-core nature]] or [[Coulombic forces|electrostatic nature]]. Instead the *[[Attraction forces between molecules| attractive]]* ones can be of different natures.
They can be often modelled as a [[Pair potential|pair potential]].
### Which is the effect of the presence of the solvent in the interparticle forces?

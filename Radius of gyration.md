It's the maximum radius from the center of mass of the molecule at which we can still find piece of the molecule itself. In the limit case of a spherical macromolecule it is equal to its radius.
In the case of a *free polymer*:
$\Large R_{g}=l\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{6}}=l\frac{\sqrt{M/M_0}}{\sqrt{6}}$ 
### What is the relation between the radius of gyration and the solvent?
If the so

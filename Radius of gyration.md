It's the maximum radius from the center of mass of the molecule at which we can still find piece of the molecule itself. In the limit case of a spherical macromolecule it is equal to its radius.
In the case of a *free polymer*:
$\Large R_{g}=l\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{6}}=l\frac{\sqrt{M/M_0}}{\sqrt{6}}$ 
### What is the relation between the radius of gyration and the solvent?
If the solvent is a [[Good and bad solvents|good solvent]] the gyration radius is *higher*, viceversa, if the solvent is a bad one the gyration radius is *lower*. This is because a good solvent can penetrate easily in the macromolecule, instead in contact with a bad solvent the macromolecule shrinks itself. 

Also the interaction with the solid is relevant.

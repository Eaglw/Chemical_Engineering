In order for the body to be in equilibrium, the resultants of forces in all directions and all the moments about the three axis should be equal to zero.
6 equations in 3D and 3 equations in 2D. 
To compute the resultants and the total moments, it's important to consider all the external forces and the reaction of every supports too. The best way to apply this concept is to use a [[Free Body Diagram]].

Shear rate refers to the rate at which a fluid or material deforms under stress when it is subjected to forces that cause it to flow or change shape. It is typically measured in units of strain per unit time.

The *strain rate* is the [[Strain|strain]] achieved per unit time. Dimension is inverse time, typically $\frac{1}{s}$. It is related to the [[Velocity gradient tensor|velocity gradient]] of the flow.

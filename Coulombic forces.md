It's the strongest force between 2 particles.
With simple comparison for a particle of atomic size, at $T_{amb}$, we can see that the electrostatic potential interat
## Electric field expression:
$\LARGE E_{1}=\frac{Q_{1}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}\epsilon r^{2}} \quad [\frac{V}{m}]$ 
where:
1. Q is the *charge*
2. $\epsilon_{0}$ is the *vacuum dielectric permittivity*
3. $\epsilon$ is the *dielecritc permittivity*
## Electrostatic force between two charges
$\LARGE F(r)=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}\epsilon r^{2}} \quad [N]$ 
## Potential interaction
$\LARGE   w(r)=\int^{\infty}_{0} -F(r)dr= \frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}\epsilon r}=\frac{z_{1}z_{2}e}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}\epsilon r} \quad [J]$
where e is the *electron charge* and $z_{i}$ is the *valency*.

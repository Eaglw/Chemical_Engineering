It's the strongest force between 2 particles.
## Electric field expression:
$\LARGE E_{1}=\frac{Q_{1}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}\epsilon r^{2}}$ 
where:
1. Q is the charge
2. $\epsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum dielectric permittivity
3. $\epsilon$ is the dielecritc permittivity
## Electrostatic force between two charges
$\LARGE F_{1}=\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0}\epsilon r^{2}}$

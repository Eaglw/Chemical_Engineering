>$\large Br=\frac{\mu u^{2}}{\kappa(T_{w}-T_{0})}=PrEc$

where:
- $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity
- $u$ is the flow velocity
- $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity
- $T_{0}$ is the bulk fluid temperature
- $T_{W}$ is the wall temperature
- $Pr$ is the [[Dimentionless numbers/Prandl number|Prandl number]]
- $Ec$ is the [[Dimentionless numbers/Eckert's number|Eckert's number]]

The *Brinkman numer* is a dimentionless number related to heat conduction from a wall to a flowing viscous fluid, commonly used in polymer processing.

>$\large Sc=\frac{\nu}{D}=\frac{\mu}{\rho D}$

where:
- $\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho}$ is the kinematic viscosity, in $\frac{m^{2}}{s}$.
- $D$ is the mass diffusivity, in $\frac{m^{2}}{s}$.
- $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, in $Pa \cdot s= N\cdot \frac{s}{m^{2}}=\frac{kg}{m\cdot s}$.
- $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, in $\frac{kg}{m^{3}}$

The Schmidt number is defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) and mass diffusivity, and it is used to characterize fluid flows in which there are simultaneous momentum and mass diffusion convection processes.

The [[Dimentionless numbers/Prandl number|Prandl number]] is the analogous for heat transfer.

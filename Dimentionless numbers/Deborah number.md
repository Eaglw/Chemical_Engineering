NOTES:
Firstly described as relaxation time over time of observation a better description has been proposed: relaxation time over "time scale of a process" or "fluid residence time".
It's important to notice that the fluid must be experiencing a deformation in order to have a De not equal to zero. So, at least locally, the flow can't be at steady state. In slowly changing or essentially steady flows, such as in fully-developed duct flows or viscometric flows like steady simple shear, the characteristic time for the deformation process is infinite and the Deborah number is therefore zero for such flows regardless of the relaxation time of the material. Thus the Deborah number alone is insufficient to fully characterise effects due to viscoelasticity.

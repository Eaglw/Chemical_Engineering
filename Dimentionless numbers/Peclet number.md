The Peclet number, denoted by the symbol Pe, is a dimensionless quantity used in fluid mechanics and heat transfer to quantify the relative importance of convection and diffusion processes in a given system. *If Pe is large, then convection is the dominant process, and if Pe is small, then diffusion is the dominant process.* 
However, it is important to note that the Peclet number can be affected by various factors, such as the fluid properties, the geometry of the system, and the presence of external forces. Therefore, it should be used with caution when making predictions about a particular system's behavior.Ô∏è

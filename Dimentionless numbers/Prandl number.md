The Prandtl number (Pr) is a dimensionless parameter used in fluid mechanics to describe the relative importance of viscous forces and thermal gradients in a fluid. It is defined as the ratio of the kinematic viscosity of a fluid to its specific heat at constant volume. The Prandtl number provides insight into the behavior of fluids under different conditions, such as heating or cooling, and can be used to predict the onset of convection and other fluid flow phenomena.

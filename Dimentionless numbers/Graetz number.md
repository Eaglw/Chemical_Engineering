The Graetz number, also known as the Graetz-Allard number, is a dimensionless parameter used to describe the behavior of heat exchange. It is defined as the ratio of the [[Dimentionless numbers/Reynolds number|Reynolds number]] to the square root of the Prandtl number. The Graetz number is used to predict the performance of various types of heat exchangers, including shell-side and tube-side turbulent flow, laminar flow, and mixed flow.Ô∏è

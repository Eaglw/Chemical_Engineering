>$\large Wi=\frac{\lambda}{t_{D}}$

where:
- $\lambda$ is the [[Rheology/Relaxation time|relaxation time]] 
- $t_{D}$ is the time of deformation
It's the ratio between the relaxation time and the characteristic time of deformation.
The same material ($\lambda$ const.) can behave differently depending of flow conditions ($t_{D}$):
- $Wi\gg 1$ the response is predominantly [[Rheology/Elasticity|elastic]]
- $Wi\ll 1$ the response is predominantly viscous
- $Wi \sim 1$ [[Rheology/Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic material]] 
Even water at room temperature ($\lambda=10^{-13}s$) can act as a viscoelastic material if the characteristic time scale of the flow is small enough (lower than $\lambda$).

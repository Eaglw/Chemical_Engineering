>$\Large Re=\frac{\rho \mathbf{u}D}{\eta}$

where: 
- $\rho$ is the density of the fluid
- $\mathbf{u}$ is its velocity
- D is the diameter of the pipe or channel
- $\eta$ is its viscosity.

The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity used in fluid mechanics to determine the flow behavior of a fluid through a pipe or channel. It is defined as the ratio of the inertial forces acting on the fluid to the viscous forces acting on it.

The Reynolds number is an important parameter in determining whether a fluid flow will be laminar or turbulent. Laminar flow occurs when the fluid flows smoothly and evenly, with no turbulence or mixing. Turbulent flow occurs when the fluid becomes agitated and mixes with itself, resulting in increased energy dissipation and heat transfer.

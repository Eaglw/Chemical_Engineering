>Any displacement of a rigid body AB an its mean plan can be described by a rotation around an absolute center of rotation C that can be determined at the intersection of the normal to the displacement vectors of two generic points of the body, with respect to their initial positions

The key point is that it's possible to completely describe the movement of a rigid body as a function of the rotation around an absolute center of rotation, that doesn't move. ![[Helper/media/Euler theorem (structure).png]]

It's a phenomenon that competes with the entropic repulsion in the presence of polymers in the system. 
The presence of free polymers(not adsorbed) can lead to the aggregation of colloidal particles because of the formation of a concentration gradient, if 2 colloidal particle come closer together, that pushes them to aggregate.
It's a rela

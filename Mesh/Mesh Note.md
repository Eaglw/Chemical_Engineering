I can provide you with the requested format for the problem solution.

## Step 1:  Understand the Problem Statement
The problem requires us to derive the continuity equation, also known as the mass balance equation, in the context of fluid dynamics. This involves starting from the macroscopic form of the mass balance and deriving it locally using the divergence theorem.

## Step 2:  Start with the Macroscopic Mass Balance Equation
The macroscopic mass balance equation is given by:


$$
- \int_{S} \rho \, \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{V} \rho \, dV
$$

This equation represents the accumulation of mass over a volume element *V* in a control surface *S*.

## Step 3:  Apply the Divergence Theorem
To convert the left-hand side from a surface integral to a volume integral, we apply the divergence theorem:

\[
\int_{S} \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dS = \int_{V} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{a} \, dV
\]

Applying this theorem to our mass balance equation gives us:

$$
- \int_{V} \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) \, dV = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{V} \rho \, dV
$$

## Step 4:  Derive the Continuity Equation Locally
Since the control volume *V* is fixed in space, we can swap the time derivative with the volume integral:

$$
- \int_{V} \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) \, dV = \int_{V} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \, dV
$$

Using integration linearity:

$$
\int_{V} \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) \right) dV = 0
$$

Since *V* is arbitrary, the integrand must be zero at each point in *V*, leading to the continuity equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

>By knowing the stress state for 3 different attitudes in P, it's possibile to determine the stress on any other attitude in P.

## Mathematical expression
The component of the *stress vector* in point P are:
$\underline{t}_{n}=(t_{nx},t_{ny},t_{nz})=\underline{\underline{T}}\cdot\underline{n}$
where:
$t_{nx}=\sigma_{xx}dx+\tau_{yx}dy+\tau_{zx}dz$
$t_{ny}=\tau_{xy}dx+\sigma_{yy}dy+\tau_{zy}dz$
$t_{nz}=\tau_{xz}dx+\tau_{yz}dy+\sigma_{zz}dz$

## Demonstration
Considering an infinitesimal *tetrahedron* with 3 faces parallel to x,y,z and the last one described by $\underline{n}$.

Statics studies the *equilibrium of bodies under applied load*, and determine the structure response. In order to be in the statics fields a body needs to be at equilibrium. 
A useful model for a body is the [[Rigid body|rigid body]], that suits well the study of the equilibrium conditions. 
The movement of a rigid body can be fully characterized by its translation plus the rotation around a center of rotation. These are its [[Degrees of freedom (structure)|degrees of freedom]].

In order to be at equilibrium, we need to saturate every degrees of freedom of the body, using a support.

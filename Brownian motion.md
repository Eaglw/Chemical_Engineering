Brownian motion is a [[Basic concepts/Stochastic variable|stochastic]] process that describes the movement of [[Colloids|colloidal particles]] suspended in a fluid or gas, as well as other systems with random motion. From a macroscopic reference system, the motion appears to be random and stochastic; however, from a microscopic perspective, it is perfectly deterministic. The underlying cause of this apparent randomness is the [[Thermal motion|thermal motion]] of the medium in which the colloids are suspended. Specifically, the motion of the colloids arises due to collisions with the particles of the surrounding medium.Ô∏è

The macroscopic manifestation of brownian motion is Fick's diffusion.

Molecular distance scale 1 Angstrom
Microscopic time scale 1 picosecond 10^-12 s, time it takes a typical atom to move of an Angstrom at room T.

Macro length is cm and macro time is min or hours.

It can be modeled with Langevin eq.

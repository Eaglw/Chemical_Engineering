Brownian motion is a [[Stochastic variable|stochastic]] process that describes the movement of [[Colloids|colloidal particles]] suspended in a fluid or gas, as well as other systems with random motion. From a macroscopic reference system, the motion appears to be random and stochastic; however, from a microscopic perspective, it is perfectly deterministic. The underlying cause of this apparent randomness is the [[Thermal motion|thermal motion]] of the medium in which the colloids are suspended. Specifically, the motion of the colloids arises due to collisions with the particles of the surrounding medium.Ô∏è

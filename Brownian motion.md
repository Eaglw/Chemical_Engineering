Brownian motion is a [[Stochastic variable|stochastic]] process that describes the movement of particles suspended in a fluid or gas, as well as other systems with random motion.
The same motion, that appears random, stochastic, from a macroscopic reference system, it's perfectly deterministic from a microscopic point of view.
In fact, it's caused by the [[Thermal motion|thermal motion]] 



In the context of physics, Brownian motion is often used as a way to study and model the behavior of particles with a certain degree of randomness or uncertainty. It can be described mathematically using the equation of motion for a collection of particles that interact with each other through random forces.
Brownian motion has many practical applications in fields such as chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science. For example, it is used to study the diffusion of molecules in fluids, the behavior of colloidal suspensions, and the movement of particles in complex systems like gels and crystals.

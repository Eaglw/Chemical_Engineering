>Necessary and sufficient condition for the position $S_{0}$ of the system S, having smooth bilateral supports, to be an equilibrium condition is that the virtual work $\delta L$ of forces is equal to zero for each virtual displacement d* from the position $S_{0}$
> $\large \delta L=0 \quad for \ any \ d^{*}$

The virtual displacement d* is an infinitesimal displacement compatible with the supports.

## Application
1. Suppress the reaction that we want to know. The system became 1 time unstable (l=1), so it can move.
2.

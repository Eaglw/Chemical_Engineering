This is a benchmark problem, a well-known problem with available results from the literature, often used to test numerical methods.

A fluid with average velocity U moves in a channel (fixed walls at distance H) with a cylinder positioned at the center line. The flow is fully developed far from the cylinder, but the obstacle perturbs the flow field. Also, the fluid exerts a drag force $F_{D}$ on the obstacle.
We want to evaluate the flow field around the cylinder and the force $F_{D}$.

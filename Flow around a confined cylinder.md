This is a benchmark problem, a well-known problem with available results from the literature, often used to test numerical methods.
The hypotesis introduced are:

1. The fluid is confined between two fixed walls at a distance H.
2. The flow is fully developed far from the cylinder.
3. The obstacle perturbs the flow field.
4. The fluid exerts a drag force $F_{D}$ on the obstacle.
5. We want to evaluate the flow field around the cylinder and the force $F_{D}$.

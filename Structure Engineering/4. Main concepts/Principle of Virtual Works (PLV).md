>Necessary and sufficient condition for the position $S_{0}$ of the system S, having smooth bilateral supports, to be an equilibrium condition is that the virtual work $\delta L$ of forces is equal to zero for each virtual displacement d* from the position $S_{0}$
> $\large \delta L=0$ for any virtual displacement

The virtual displacement d* is an infinitesimal displacement compatible with the supports.
## Purpose
The PLV is a useful tool for determining only one reaction of a support without having to solve the entire structure. This can be particularly advantageous in cases where solving the entire structure is too complex or time-consuming. But it can also be applied to each one of the supports in order to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the system.
## Application
1. Suppress the reaction that we want to know. The system became 1 time unstable (l=1), so it can move.
2. With the [[Structure Engineering/4. Main concepts/Collapsible mechanism theorem|collapsible mechanism]], check if the centers of all the bodies are alligned.
3. Assign a virtual displacement d* to the body
4. Calculate the displacement in the application point of the forces and the reaction that we are interested in
5. Find the reaction imposing the global virtual work $\delta L=0$

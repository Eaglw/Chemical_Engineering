>It blocks both the horizontal and the vertical movements, but rotation is still possible

Blocking 2 translational components, the saturated [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Degrees of freedom (structure)|degrees of freedom]] are 2. Instead, the rotation is not effected because the center of the rotation is the support itself, making impossible to contrast the rotation with any [[Moment|moment]].

# Ideal hinge
Two [[Structure Engineering/2. Supports/Link|link]] with non parallel axis can represent an ideal hinge, with the same characteristics.
# Internal hinge
It connects two bodies, and has the same characteristics of the hinge, but it blocks the relative movements between the two elements.
It blocks relative axial and orthogonal translations, relative rotations are allowed.

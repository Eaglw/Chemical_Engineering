The two main materials used in civil structures are concrete and steel.
# Concrete
Concrete, better known as *cementitious conglomerate*, is composed, for each $m^3$ as:
- 0.8 $m^3$ coarse inert (stone chippings, gravel)
- 0.4 $m^3$ fine inert (sand)
- 300 kg cement
- 120 % 250 L of water
Even if the components are more the one $m^3$, due to the reactions between them, void inside the elements and the evaporation of water that leaves voids in the final product too, these proportion leads to 1 $m^3$ of concrete.
The *water to cement ratio* (circa 0.4,0.5), is relevant in the analysis of the final resistance of the concrete. More water means easier application of the concrete during the building process and higher maximum deformation achievable before rupture, instead less water means more strength. 
That is the reason for the difference in strength, in tension and compression, for different sample of the same concrete. 
## Compression test
The main characteristic of concrete is its strength in *compression*, quite higher respect to the one in traction, circa 10 times the tension strength.

The basic compression test is composed by a 28 days old, 15x15x15 cm, cubic concrete block, pressed into a compression machine. Deformation and stress are evaluated during the process, till rupture of the sample.
Measuring compression strength with a cubic sample is not the most accurate way, because the test is not purely uniaxial. With a purely uniaxial test we should have a free orthogonal expansion of the sample, but the compression machine limits this expansion. There are border effects that alter the results.
A cylindrical sample, having the height H double the diameter D, can lead to more accurate results. 
It can be seen that the cylindrical strength is lower respect to the cubic one, and is approximately 0.83 times the cubic one. 

The codes for different concretes are C20/25. The lower number refers to the cylindrical strength in MPa, and the higher refers to the cubic one, in MPa.

## Confinement of concrete

![[Helper/media/5. Mechanical properties of materials-1.png]]

The border effect present in compression test of a cubic sample suggest us that any sort of confinement can improve the strength of the sample. This is even more evident for the ultimate strain, that can be up to 4 times higher respect to the unconfined concrete. The confinement can be made by steel ropes surrounding the concrete, or transversal reinforcement bar in a concrete column. 
## Young Modulus
The young modulus is slope of the linear stress-strain graph part, but in the case of concrete we see non linear behaviour very early. We can make a linear regression in the almost linear part of the graph, till 30-40%. 
The rule of thumb to evaluate the young modulus is:
$\LARGE E_{c}=22000 \cdot ( \frac{f_{cm}}{10} )^{0.3}$ in MPa
where $f_{cm}$ is mean value of cylindrical sample strength.
~~The statistical distribution allow us to link the cylindrical 5% strength of the distribution $f_{ck}=f_{cm}-8$ in MPa (?????)~~

## Tension test
A pure tensile strength test is hard for concrete, so the best approach is the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/4 point bending test|4 point bending test]]. 

# Steel
Today we use only *corrugated* bars of steel, in order to have no slip at all between steel and concrete. 
Mechanical properties of steel are tested in tension.

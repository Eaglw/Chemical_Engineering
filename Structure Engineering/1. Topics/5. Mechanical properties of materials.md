The two main materials used in civil structures are concrete and steel.
# Concrete
Concrete, better known as *cementitious conglomerate*, is composed, for each $m^3$ as:
- 0.8 $m^3$ coarse inert (stone chippings, gravel)
- 0.4 $m^3$ fine inert (sand)
- 300 kg cement
- 120 % 250 L of water
Even if the components are more the one $m^3$, due to the reactions between them, void inside the elements and the evaporation of water that leaves voids in the final product too, these proportion leads to 1 $m^3$ of concrete.

The two main materials used in civil structures are concrete and steel.
# Concrete
Concrete, better known as *cementitious conglomerate*, is composed, for each $m^3$ as:
- 0.8 $m^3$ coarse inert (stone chippings, gravel)
- 0.4 $m^3$ fine inert (sand)
- 300 kg cement
- 120 % 250 L of water
Even if the components are more the one $m^3$, due to the reactions between them, void inside the elements and the evaporation of water that leaves voids in the final product too, these proportion leads to 1 $m^3$ of concrete.
The *water to cement ratio* (circa 0.4,0.5), is relevant in the analysis of the final resistance of the concrete. More water means easier application of the concrete during the building process, instead less water means more strength.

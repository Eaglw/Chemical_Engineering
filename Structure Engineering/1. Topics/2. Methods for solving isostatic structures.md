# Equations of equilibrium
The [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Equations of equilibrium|equations of equilibrium]] allow us to understand if the supports are enough to be at equilibrium. The [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Free Body Diagram|free body diagram]] help us to view these equations in a practical way and to write the equations in order to find the reaction needed.
# Internal characteristics of solicitations
To represent the most common civil structures we can usually model them as composed with rectilinear elements. The axis line is a good approximation of these elements. The [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Cantilever beam|cantilever beam]] is a good example. 

Applying the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Principle of sectioning|principle of sectioning]], we can derive the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Internal characteristics of solicitations|internal characteristics of solicitations]], that is useful also to understand visually the load on different bodies or different body parts. The relation between the load, the shear and the momentum are defined by the [[Structure Engineering/4. Main concepts/Indefinite equations of equilibrium|indefinite equations of equilibrium]].


With the [[Structure Engineering/4. Main concepts/Principle of Virtual Works (PLV)|PLV]] is possible to resolve a [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Determinate structure|determinate structure]], knowing the supports reactions and the internal characteristic of solicitations.

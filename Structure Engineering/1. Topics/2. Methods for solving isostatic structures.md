# Equations of equilibrium
The most straightforward method to solve a structure, so to find all the reactions exerted by the supports, is using the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Equations of equilibrium|equations of equilibrium]]. The [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Free Body Diagram|free body diagram]] help us to view these equations in a practical way and to write the equations in order to find the reaction needed.
# Internal characteristics of solicitations and indefinite equations of equilibrium
Applying the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Principle of sectioning|principle of sectioning]], we can derive the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Internal characteristics of solicitations|internal characteristics of solicitations]], that is useful also to understand visually the load on different bodies or different body parts. The relation between the load, the shear and the momentum are defined by the [[Structure Engineering/4. Main concepts/Indefinite equations of equilibrium|indefinite equations of equilibrium]].
# Principle of Virtual Work
Another approach to solve a [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Determinate structure|determinate structure]] is to use the [[Structure Engineering/4. Main concepts/Principle of Virtual Works (PLV)|Principle of Virtual Works (PLV)]], that if we don't need to find every reactions in a structure. 
In this approach, it's useful the [[Structure Engineering/4. Main concepts/Collapsible mechanism theorem|collapsible mechanism theorem]].

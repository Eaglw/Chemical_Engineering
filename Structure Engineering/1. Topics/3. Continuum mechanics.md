In continuum mechanics, [[Rheology/Stress|stress]] refers to the distribution of forces within a material that causes it to deform or change shape. The stress concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of solids and fluids under various types of loading conditions.
In three-dimensional space, stress can be represented by a tensor called the [[Rheology/Stress tensor|stress tensor]], denoted by T. This second-order tensor has nine components, which describe the forces per unit area acting on an infinitesimal cube of material. 
## Cauchy stress theorem
The [[Cauchy stress theorem|Cauchy stress theorem]], provides a fundamental relationship between the stress tensor and the external forces acting on the material. This theorem states that the stress tensor at a point within the material is equal to the average force per unit area applied to an infinitesimal cube of material that contains that point.
## Elastic, homogeneous, isotropic
In structure analysis we can often use some assumptions: the material that we use can be threated as [[Rheology/Elasticity|perfectly elastic]], *homogeneous* and *isotropic*.
These assumptions are generally safe because of the scale of structure analysis. Even if [[concrete|concrete]] is not homogeneous by definition, the scale of a structure is large enough to neglect it completely.
# Components of strain
In structure analysis we deal with structure at equilibrium, so any displacement possible is just deformation. Of course we consider only *small deformations*, at least very small compared to the length scale of a structure. 
We can divide the displacements in components (u,v,w) relative to x,y,z directions. The displacements must be continuous function in order to not have ruptures. (u,v,w) are relative to a displacement of the point O, origin of the system, but any other point A distant dx from O will have a displacement: $u+\frac{du}{dx}dx$, or $v+\frac{dv}{dy}dy$, or $w+\frac{dw}{dz}dz$.
## Angular distorsion
![[Helper/media/3. Continuum mechanics.png|300]]
The angle of OA' respect to OA will be: $\frac{\left( u+\frac{du}{dx}dx-u \right)}{dx}=\frac{du}{dx}$, analogously, the angle of OB' respect to OB will be $\frac{dv}{dy}$. So the total angle A'OB' will be $\frac{du}{dx}+\frac{dv}{dy}$.

So the components of strain are:
- $\epsilon_{x}=\frac{du}{dx}$
- $\epsilon_{y}=\frac{dv}{dy}$
- $\epsilon_{z}=\frac{dw}{dz}$
- $\gamma_{xy}=\frac{du}{dx}+\frac{dv}{dy}$
- $\gamma_{xz}=\frac{du}{dz}+\frac{dw}{dz}$
- $\gamma_{yz}=\frac{dv}{dy}+\frac{dw}{dz}$
The deformation tensor also is symmetric: $\gamma_{xy}=\gamma_{yx}$ and so on.

It can also be demonstrated that given the components of strain in a point, it's possible to determine the elongation in any direction and the angular distortion between any two directions.

## Elastic, homogeneous, isotropic
In structure analysis we can often use some assumptions: the material that we use can be threated as [[Rheology/Elasticity|perfectly elastic]], *homogeneous* and *isotropic*.
These assumptions are generally safe because of the scale of structure analysis. Even if [[concrete|concrete]] is not homogeneous by definition, the scale of a structure is large enough to neglect it completely.
# Components of strain
In structure analysis we deal with structure at equilibrium, so any displacement possible is just deformation. Of course we consider only *small deformations*, at least very small compared to the length scale of a structure. 
We can divide the displacements in components (u,v,w) relative to x,y,z directions. The displacements must be continuous function in order to not have ruptures. (u,v,w) are relative to a displacement of the point O, origin of the system, but any other point A distant dx from O will have a displacement: $u+\frac{du}{dx}dx$, or $v+\frac{dv}{dy}dy$, or $w+\frac{dw}{dz}dz$.

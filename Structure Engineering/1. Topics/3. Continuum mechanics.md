## Elastic, homogeneous, isotropic
In structure analysis we can often use some assumptions: the material that we use can be threated as [[Rheology/Elasticity|perfectly elastic]], *homogeneous* and *isotropic*.
These assumptions are generally safe because of the scale of structure analysis. Even if [[concrete|concrete]] is not homogeneous by definition, the scale of a structure is large enough to neglect it completely.

### what are the equation of equilibrium? 
[[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Equations of equilibrium|Equations of equilibrium]] are a way to solve a structure, and tell us that the sum of all the forces and moments applied on a body must be zero, in order for the body to be at equilibrium.
$\LARGE\sum F_{x}=0;\sum F_{y}=0;\sum F_{z}=0$
$\LARGE\sum M_{x}=0;\sum M_{y}=0;\sum M_{z}=0$
3 in 2D and 6 in 3D.

### What is the convenction for positive moments?
counter-clockwise 

### what is the Principle of sectioning?
[[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Principle of sectioning|Principle of sectioning]] tells us that if a structure is in equilibrium every part of the structure must be in equilibrium, so we can cut the structure in every part and apply the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Equations of equilibrium|Equations of equilibrium]].

### are the internal characteristic of solicitations continouos functions?
yes unless there is some load applied in the section that we are considering. It can be both a punctual or a distributed load.

### what a rigid body is?
The [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Rigid body|Rigid body]] is an approximation to consider the deformations inside a body negligible.

### what are the degrees of freedom of a body?
the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Degrees of freedom (structure)|Degrees of freedom]] are the number of cartesian coordinates needed in order to fully describe the configuration of a body. 3 in 2D 6 in 3D.

### what is the linearization pf rigidity constraints and in which cases it can be applied?
We can approximate a circular trajectory with its tangent, in the hp of small displacements, that are that we encounter in structural analysis.

### which is the relation between the Euler th and the theory of centers? + enunciato del th.
[[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Euler theorem (structure)|Euler theorem]]: "Any displacement of a rigid body AB an its mean plan can be described by a rotation around an absolute center of rotation C that can be determined at the intersection of the normal to the displacement vectors of two generic points of the body, with respect to their initial positions"
[[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Theory of Centers|Theory of Centers]]: If we can find ad absolute rotation center the body is not in equilibrium, and viceversa.
Euler say that any movement can be seen as a rotation, so if we have a center no equilibrium.

### what a rigid body is?
The [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Rigid body|Rigid body]] is an approximation to consider the deformations inside a body negligible.

### what are the degrees of freedom of a body?
the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Degrees of freedom (structure)|Degrees of freedom]] are the number of cartesian coordinates needed in order to fully describe the configuration of a body. 3 in 2D 6 in 3D.

### what is the linearization pf rigidity constraints and in which cases it can be applied?
We can approximate a circular trajectory

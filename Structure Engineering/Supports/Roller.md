>It blocks vertical axial movements, rotation is still possible

Blocking 1 translational components, the saturated [[Structure Engineering/Degrees of freedom (structure)|degrees of freedom]] is 1. 
Any point along its axis can be the *center of rotation*.
Instead, the rotation is not effected because the center of the rotation is the support itself, making impossible to contrast the rotation with any [[Moment|moment]].

>It blocks axial movements and rotation 

Blocking 1 translational component and the rotation, the saturated [[Structure Engineering/Degrees of freedom (structure)|degrees of freedom]] are 2.
The only *center of rotation* is the *improper center* at infinity in its axis.
# Internal slider
It connects two bodies, and has the same characteristics of the slider, but it blocks the relative movements between the two elements.

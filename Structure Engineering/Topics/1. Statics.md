Statics studies the *equilibrium of bodies under applied load*, and determine the structure response. In order to be in the statics fields a body needs to be at equilibrium. 
A useful model for a body is the [[Structure Engineering/Rigid body|rigid body]], that suits well the study of the equilibrium conditions. 
The movement of a rigid body can be fully characterized by its translation plus the rotation around a center of rotation. These are its [[Structure Engineering/Degrees of freedom (structure)|degrees of freedom]].
In the hypothesis of *small displacements*, we can apply the *linearization of the rigidity constrains* for a circular trajectory. It means that circular trajectories are exchanged with the tangent rectilinear ones. 
Generalizing, we obtain the [[Structure Engineering/Euler theorem (structure)|Euler theorem]], that is useful to determinate the existence of a center of rotation, that for the [[Structure Engineering/Theory of Centers|theory of centers]] implies the absence of equilibrium.
In order to be at equilibrium, we need to saturate every degrees of freedom of the body, using a support. 
## Supports 
[[Structure Engineering/Supports/Hinge - Pin|Hinge - Pin]]
[[Structure Engineering/Supports/Roller|Roller]]
[[Slider|Slider]]
[[Double slider|Double slider]]
[[Link|Link]]
[[Ideal hinge|Ideal hinge]]

The [[Equations of equilibrium|equations of equilibrium]] allow us to understand if the supports are enough to be at equilibrium. The [[Free Body Diagram|free body diagram]] help us to view these equations in a practical way, and to write the equations in order to find the reaction needed.

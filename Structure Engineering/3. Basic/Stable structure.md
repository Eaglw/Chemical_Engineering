>A structure is unstable, so it’s not in equilibrium, if there are partial or improper constraints. 

Evaluating the body’s degrees of freedom minus the saturated degrees of freedom provided by the supports can be misleading. 
The results can be zero, but the presence of improper constraints implies that the structure is still unstable. An easy verification can be made with the theory of center.

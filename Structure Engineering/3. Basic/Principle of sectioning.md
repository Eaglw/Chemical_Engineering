>If a structure is in equilibrium every part of it must be at equilibrium

This is useful to study the internal solicitations of a structure, because we can apply the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Equations of equilibrium|equations of equilibrium]] for each part of the structure.
Every "section" of the structure, between two cuts, must be at equilibrium. So, for every cut in the structure there must be internal reciprocal solicitations between the two parts. This applies also to every infinitesimal slice of the structure.

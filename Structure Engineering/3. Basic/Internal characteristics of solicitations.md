They are represented by the resultants of the internal forces of:
- The *axial forces N* along the axis
- The *shear force V or T* orthogonal to the axis
- The *moment M*
We can evaluate the internal forces of each slice of the structure applying the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Principle of sectioning|principle of sectioning]].

Rewrite the following in the context of structure engineering with correct grammar:
Considering an infinitesimal slice of the body, we can see the variations of these resultants in function of the axial coordinate. These functions are continue, but each puntual forces applied in a body is a discontinuity.

In the context of structural engineering, when examining an infinitesimal element of a body, one can observe how the magnitude of these resultants varies with respect to the axial coordinate. These functions are continuous, meaning that they have no breaks or jumps at any given point. However, it is important to note that each individual force applied to a particular point within the body represents a discontinuity in this continuity. This means that while the overall function may appear smooth and uninterrupted, there are specific points where the forces acting on the element change abruptly, creating a break in the continuity of the resultant forces.️


The conventions for the resultants are:
- *Axial forces* $N>0$: traction, the force point outward the volume element.
- *Shear forces* $T$ or $V>0$: if create a *clockwise* moment respect to the center of the element.
- *Moment* $M>0$: if it *tends the bottom fibers*.

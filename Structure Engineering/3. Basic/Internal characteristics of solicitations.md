They are represented by the resultants of the internal forces of:
- The *axial forces N* along the axis
- The *shear force V or T* orthogonal to the axis
- The *moment M*
We can evaluate the internal forces of each slice of the structure applying the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Principle of sectioning|principle of sectioning]].

When examining an infinitesimal element of a body, one can observe how the magnitude of these resultants varies with respect to the axial coordinate. These functions are *continuous*, meaning that they have no breaks or jumps at any given point, unless the presence of individual force applied to a particular point within the body, that represents a *discontinuity* in these functions.

The conventions for the resultants are:

- *Axial forces* $N>0$: traction, the force point outward the volume element.
- *Shear forces* $T$ or $V>0$: if create a *clockwise* moment respect to the center of the element.
- *Moment* $M>0$: if it *tends the bottom fibers*.

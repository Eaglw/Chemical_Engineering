A structure is *statically determinate* if it's possible to determine all its forces with the [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Equations of equilibrium|equations of equilibrium]].
If there are more unknowns than equations the structure is *statically indeterminate*.
Considering a 2D co-planar structure, if t is the number of bodies and s are the number of *effective supports*, or the saturated [[Structure Engineering/3. Basic/Degrees of freedom (structure)|degrees of freedom]]:
- Statically determinate: $3t-s=0$
- Statically indeterminate: $3t-s<0$

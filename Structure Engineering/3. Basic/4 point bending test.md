Perform a tensile strength test for concrete is hard, it's easier to test the tensile resistance due to flexure. It's performed applying two symmetric loads on a simple supported beam.

In the central part of the beam we have a constant moment, equal to it's maximum. $M_{max}=P \cdot a$ where P is the force, and a the distance of the force from the support. 
The *tensile strength in flexure* is the stress related to this moment: $\sigma_{max}=\frac{M_{max}}{w}$ where $w=\frac{I_{n}}{\frac{H}{2}}$ is the resisting modulus of the rectangular section. 
The tensile strength in flexure is about 1.2 times the one in pure traction, because in flexion only the outer fibers are at the maximum tension, instead of all of them. In fact, the stress diagram is a butterfly one.

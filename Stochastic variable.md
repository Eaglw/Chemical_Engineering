A stochastic variable is a mathematical variable that takes on values that are *random or uncertain*. In other words, it is a variable whose possible values are determined by a *probability distribution* rather than a fixed relationship between the variable and its underlying causes.
They can be described using probability distributions like the normal distribution(Gaussian), Poisson distribution, or others.

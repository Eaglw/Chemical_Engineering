Perform a tensile strength test for concrete is hard, it's easier to test the tensile resistance due to flexure. It's performed applying two symmetric loads on a simple supported beam.

In the central part of the beam we have a constant moment, equal to it's maximum. $M_{max}=P \cdot a$ where P is the force, and a the distance of the force from the support. 
The stress related to this moment is $\sigma_{max}=\frac{M_{max}}{w}$ where $w=\frac{I_{n}}{\frac{H}{2}}$ is the resisting modulus of the rectangular section. 

The stress diagram is a butterfly one.

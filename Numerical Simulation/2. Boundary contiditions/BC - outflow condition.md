>$\mathbf{T\cdot n}=-p_{out}\mathbf{n}$

where:
1. $\mathbf{T}$ is the [[Stress tensor|stress tensor]].
2. $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector pointing outward. 

Physically, this condition represents an outlet in an ambient at pressure $p_{out}$   
With this condition on a boundary of the domain, the velocity profile is not univocally defined and depends on the specific problem.
The quantity $\mathbf{T\cdot n}$ is the «traction», which is the force exerted by the fluid   
on the boundary.

Esempio per vedere che in uscita abbiamo non fully developed flow

## Alternative BC that takes into account only the normal outflow

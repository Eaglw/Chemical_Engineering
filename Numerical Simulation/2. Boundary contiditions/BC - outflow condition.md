>$\mathbf{T\cdot n}=-p_{out}\mathbf{n}$

where:
1. $\mathbf{T}$ is the [[Stress tensor|stress tensor]].
2. $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector pointing outward. 

Physically, this condition represents an outlet in an ambient at pressure $p_{out}$   
• At variance with the previous one, the condition on a boundary of the   
domain where the fluid exits is not univocally defined and depends on   
the specific problem   

• The quantity T • n is the «traction», which is the force exerted by the fluid   
on the boundary

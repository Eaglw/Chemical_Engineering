This condition corresponds to an inlet flux normal to the boundary   
where the normal stress is the specified pressure $P_{in}$ and is used when the pressure is known on an inflow boundary of the domain.
It is formally equivalent to the [[BC]]   
previously reported, the only different being that now the constant on the   
right-hand side is the (known) pressure on the inlet boundary

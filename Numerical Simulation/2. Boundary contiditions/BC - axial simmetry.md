The condition of axial symmetry is formally identical to the symmetry   
condition and can be applied to problems where a point (in 2D) or an axis (in 3D) can be identified such that *the system is geometrically and physically equivalent for rotations around such point or axis*.
Differently from the simmetry condition, the existence of a axial symmetry condition *reduces the dimensionality of the problem* (2D ->1 D, 3D -> 2D).

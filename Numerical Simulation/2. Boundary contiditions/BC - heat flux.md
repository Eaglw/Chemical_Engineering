This condition imposes a heat flux across a boundary that can be directly a known quantity $q_{BC}$ or it can be assigned through a heat transfer coefficient h.
Physically, a heat transfer coefficient h means a contact of the boundary with an external ambient at temperature $T_{\infty}$. Of course, in this case, the value of h depends on the problem and on the wall geometry, and it must be known a priori.
The heat flux can enter or exit the domain, depending on the sign of $q_{BC}$ and the direction of $\mathbf{n}$.

## Adiabatic case
An adiabatic boundary is a particular case of this boundary condition, with $q_{BC}=0$.

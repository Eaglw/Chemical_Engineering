The periodicity condition in imposed when a *domain infinitely repeats* (both geometrically and physically) along one direction. The velocity profile must be the same on both the boundaries along the flow.

## Flow generated by a pressure gradient
In the case of a flow generated by a pressure difference $\Delta p$, the pressure *is not periodic*, since the motion of the fluid is generated by a pressure difference.
Hence, the periodic condition on the pressure must be:
$p|_{A}=p|_{B}+\Delta p=p|_{C}+2\Delta p$
So, the pressure is equal across the periodic domains *plus a constant pressure jump*. 
Another way to model this condition is to define an absolute flow rate instead of a pressure jump.

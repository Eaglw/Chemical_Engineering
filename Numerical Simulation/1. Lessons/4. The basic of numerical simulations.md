Every numerical simulation requires some steps in order to be performed. These step can be divided in 4 categories. 
1. Steps related to the identification of the physical problem and the mathematical model that represent it in the most efficient way,
2. Steps related to the problem setup, like geometry, mesh and boundary conditions. 
3. Steps related to the numerical convergence of the problem.
4. Steps related to the analysis of the results.

# Physical problem
To understand better the role of each step we will study the [[Flow around a confined cylinder|flow around a confined cylinder]].
# Mathematical model
Assuming Newtonian incompressible flow, in isothermal condition and with negligible gravity forces, we can model the system with the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Navier-Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]]. There is no analytical solution to these equations, so a numerical simulation in needed to evaluate the drag force on the cylinder. 
Often is useful to work with the [[Adimensionalization of the Navier-Stockes equations|dimentionless form]] of the Navier-Stockes equations, to reduce the number or parameters from 4 ($\rho, \eta, D, U$) to 1, the [[Dimentionless numbers/Reynolds number|Reynolds number]].

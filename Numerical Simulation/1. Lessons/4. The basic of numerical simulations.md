Every numerical simulation requires some steps in order to be performed. These step can be divided in 4 categories. 
1. Everything related to the identification of the physical problem and the mathematical model that represent it in the most efficient way,
2. Everything related to the problem setup, like geometry, mesh and boundary conditions. 
3. Everything related to the numerical convergence of the problem.
4. Everything related to the analysis of the results.

To understand better the role of each step, we can analyze a benchmark problem.

Every numerical simulation requires some steps in order to be performed. These step can be divided in 4 categories. 
1. Steps related to the identification of the physical problem and the mathematical model that represent it in the most efficient way,
2. Steps related to the problem setup, like geometry, mesh and boundary conditions. 
3. Steps related to the numerical convergence of the problem.
4. Steps related to the analysis of the results.

To understand better the role of each step, we can analize a benchmark problem, a well-known problem with available results from the literature, often used to test numerical methods. In this case we will study the [[Flow around a confined cylinder|flow around a confined cylinder]].

Modelling transport phenomena goes through the writing of [[Basic concepts/Balance equations|balance equations]].
A fluid dynamic problem, in its general form, can be modelled with this coupled system of partial differential equations:
1. [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Mass balance equation|Mass balance equation]]
$\LARGE \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot \rho \textbf{u}=0$ 
2. [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Momentum balance equations|Momentum balance equations]]
$\LARGE \rho \frac{\partial \textbf{u}}{\partial t} + \rho \textbf{u} \cdot \nabla \textbf{u} = \nabla \cdot \textbf{T}+\textbf{F}$
3. [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Energy balance equation|Energy balance equation]]
$\LARGE \rho c_{P} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \rho c_{P} \textbf{u} \cdot \nabla T = - \nabla \cdot \textbf{q} + \boldsymbol{\sigma} :\nabla \textbf{u} - \frac{\partial ln \rho}{\partial ln T} \bigg|_{p} \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}+\textbf{u} \cdot \nabla p \right) + S$
4. [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Species transport equations|Species transport equations]]
 $\LARGE \rho(\frac{\partial\omega_{i}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{\overline{u}} \cdot \nabla \omega_{i})=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{j_{i}}+r_{i}$ for $i=1,\dots,N-1$
 
Generally, all the physical and chemical parameters involved depend on pressure and temperature.
# Summary
To solve these equations, proper [[Basic concepts/Boundary conditions|boundary]] and initial (in the transient case) conditions need to be specified. Several types of boundary conditions can be assigned depending on the geometry and the physics of the problem. 
The solution of the equations gives the velocity, pressure, temperature, and composition in every point of the domain and at every time instant.
From the local fields, integral quantities (such as force, torque, flow rate, global heat transfer coefficient, etc.) can be calculated.
Due to the complexity of these equations, a numerical method (through a CFD software) is required.

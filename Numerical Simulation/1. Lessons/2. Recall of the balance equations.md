# Summary
To solve these equations, proper boundary conditions need to be specified initial (in the transient   
• Several types of boundary conditions can be assigned depending on the   
geometry and the physics of the problem (see next Lectures)   
• The solution of the equations gives the velocity, pressure, temperature,   
and composition in every point of the domain and at every time instant   
• From the local fields, integral quantities (such as force, torque, flow rate,   
global heat transfer coefficient, etc.) can be calculated   
• Due to the complexity of these equations, a numerical method (through   
a CFD software) is required

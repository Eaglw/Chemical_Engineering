The coexistence of two or more immiscible phases makes the modelling and simulation of the dispersion fluid dynamics much more complex as compared to the single phase case. 
The first reason to this increase in complexity is that even in the most basic case, like a newtonian fluid, the presence of particles can alter the rheological properties, so it may occur typical non newtonian phenomena. This is due to the *interparticle hydrodynamic interactions*, long-range interaction vehicolated by the perturbation of the fluid field caused by the motion of one particle, that influences the motion of the others.
The other reason of the increasing complexity is that the elements required for the modelling of the system increase significantly, including N (as the number of particles) more boundaries, translational and angular velocity balance. 


The easiest case is a rigid particle [[Rheology/Suspensions|suspensions]] with a [[Newtonian fluid|newtonian]] suspending liquid.

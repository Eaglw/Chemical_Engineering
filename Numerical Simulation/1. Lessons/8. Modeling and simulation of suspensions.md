The coexistence of two or more immiscible phases makes the modelling and simulation of the dispersion fluid dynamics much more complex as compared to the single phase case. 
The first reason to this increase in complexity is that even in the most basic case, like a newtonian fluid, the presence of particles can alter the rheological properties, so it may occur typical non newtonian phenomena. This is due to the *interparticle hydrodynamic interactions*, long-range interaction vehicolated by the perturbation of the fluid field caused by the motion of one particle, that influences the motion of the others.
The other reason of the increasing complexity is that the elements required for the modelling of the system increase significantly, including N (as the number of particles) more boundaries, translational and angular velocity balance. 

In the case of a dispersion fluid dynamics involving two or more immiscible phases, the modeling and simulation process becomes significantly more complex compared to that of a single phase system. This is due to several factors, including the presence of particles in the fluid, which can alter its rheological properties and lead to non-Newtonian phenomena.

One of the primary reasons for this increase in complexity is the interparticle hydrodynamic interactions, which are long-range interactions that occur between particles in a fluid. These interactions are mediated by the perturbation of the fluid field caused by the motion of one particle, which influences the motion of others. This can lead to phenomena such as particle clustering and phase separation, which can significantly impact the behavior of the system.

Another reason for the increased complexity is the need to account for additional elements in the modeling process, including a larger number of boundaries (N) and the need to balance both translational and angular velocities. This requires a more sophisticated understanding of fluid dynamics and particle behavior, as well as the ability to accurately model these interactions in a simulation environment.

Overall, the coexistence of multiple immiscible phases in a dispersion fluid dynamics system can significantly increase the complexity of modeling and simulation processes. However, with careful consideration of the underlying physics and the use of advanced computational techniques, it is possible to accurately model and simulate these systems and gain valuable insights into their behavior.Ô∏è

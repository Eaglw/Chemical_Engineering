In the case of a dispersion fluid dynamics involving two or more immiscible phases, the modelling and simulation process becomes significantly more complex compared to that of a single phase system. 
The primary reason for this increase in complexity is the *interparticle hydrodynamic interactions*, which are long-range interactions that occur between particles in a fluid. These interactions are mediated by the perturbation of the fluid field caused by the motion of one particle, which influences the motion of others. These interaction can alter the fluid dynamics, and consequently the rheological properties of the fluid. Even if if the continuous phase is a newtonian liquid, typical non newtonian phenomena may occur.
Another reason for the increased complexity is the need to account for additional elements in the modelling process, including a larger number of boundaries (N) and the need to balance both translational and angular velocities for each particle. 

Ô∏èThe easiest case is a rigid particle [[Rheology/Suspensions|suspensions]] with a [[Newtonian fluid|newtonian]] suspending liquid.
## Assumption for this case
The particles are:
- Spherical
- Rigid
- Equal in size
- Sufficiently big to neglect the [[Soft Matter/Brownian motion|brownian motion]]
The fluid is:
- Incompressible newtonian
- In isothermal conditions
- In absence of external forces

To model this system we need to add to the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Mass balance equation|mass]] and the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Momentum balance equations|momentum]] balance equations the motion equations of the i-th particles:
- $\large m_{i} \frac{d\mathbf{U}_{i}}{dt}=\mathbf{F}_{i}=\int _{\partial P_{i}(t)} \mathbf{T \cdot n}\, dS$
- $\large I_{i} \frac{d\mathbf{w}_{i}}{dt}=\mathbf{M}_{i}=\int _{\partial P_{i}(t)} \mathbf{r \times (T\cdot n)}\, dS$

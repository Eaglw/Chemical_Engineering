The coexistence of two or more immiscible phases makes the modeling and simulation of the dispersion fluid dynamics much more complex as compared to the single phase case. This complexity comes from two 


The easiest case is a rigid particle [[Rheology/Suspensions|suspensions]] with a [[Newtonian fluid|newtonian]] suspending liquid.

spherical rigid monodisperse no brownian motion

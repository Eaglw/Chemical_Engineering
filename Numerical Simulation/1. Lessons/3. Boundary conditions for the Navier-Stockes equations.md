To solve a problem governed by partial differential equations (PDE), [[Basic concepts/Boundary conditions|Boundary conditions]] and, if the problem is time dependent, *initial conditions* need to be provided.
A wrong formulation of this conditions can lead to wrong physical phenomena and numerical problems.

Depending on the physics of the problem, we can apply many different boundary conditions:
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - velocity profile|BC - velocity profile]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - outflow condition|BC - outflow condition]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - pressure inlet|BC - pressure inlet]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - simmetry|BC - simmetry]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - axial simmetry|BC - axial simmetry]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - periodicity(flow)|BC - periodicity(flow)]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - slip condition|BC - slip condition]]

# Pressure
From a mathematical point of view, the pressure is well-defined by the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Navier-Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] describing the conservation of mass and momentum, *up to an arbitrary additive constant*, because in the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Momentum balance equations|Momentum balance equations]] the pressure appears only as a spatial derivative term. That means that if the field $p(x,y,z,t)$ satisfies the Navier-Stokes equations, the same holds for the field $p(x,y,z,t) + c$ where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.
In other words, to define the pressure level, it is necessary to specify the pressure in *only one point of the domain*. The point in which we specifies the pressure does not effect the final solution, and, in the incompressible fluid case, neither the absolute value of pressure does. If the fluid is compressible, the absolute value of the pressure is relevant only because it effects the density of the fluid, and, in turn, the velocity field.

The pressure level in a point must be specified only if no boundary condition contains information on the pressure level, like the outflow condition does.

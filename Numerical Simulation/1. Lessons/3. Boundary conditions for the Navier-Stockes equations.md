To solve a problem governed by partial differential equations (PDE), [[Basic concepts/Boundary conditions|Boundary conditions]] and, if the problem is time dependent, *initial conditions* need to be provided.
A wrong formulation of this conditions can lead to wrong physical phenomena and numerical problems.

Depending on the physics of the problem, we can apply many different boundary conditions:
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - velocity profile|BC - velocity profile]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - outflow condition|BC - outflow condition]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - pressure inlet|BC - pressure inlet]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - simmetry|BC - simmetry]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - axial simmetry|BC - axial simmetry]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - periodicity|BC - periodicity]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - slip condition|BC - slip condition]]

# Pressure
From a mathematical point of view, the pressure is well-defined by the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Navier-Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] describing the conservation of mass and momentum, *up to an arbitrary additive constant*, because in the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Momentum balance equations|Momentum balance equations]] the pressure appears only as a spatial derivative term.


In other words,    
• To define the pressure level, it is necessary to specify the pressure in   
one point of the domain   
• The pressure level and the point of the domain where it is specified are   
arbitrary and do not affect the final solution

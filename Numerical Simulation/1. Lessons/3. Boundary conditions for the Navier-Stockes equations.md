To solve a problem governed by partial differential equations (PDE), [[Basic concepts/Boundary conditions|Boundary conditions]] and, if the problem is time dependent, *initial conditions* need to be provided.
A wrong formulation of this conditions can lead to wrong physical phenomena and numerical problems.


All initial and boundary must be chosen so that:

Depending on the physics of the problem, we can apply many different boundary conditions:
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - velocity profile|BC - velocity profile]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - outflow condition|BC - outflow condition]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - pressure inlet|BC - pressure inlet]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - simmetry|BC - simmetry]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - axial simmetry|BC - axial simmetry]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - periodicity|BC - periodicity]]
- [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary contiditions/BC - slip condition|BC - slip condition]]

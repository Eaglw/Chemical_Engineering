# Non isothermal system
If the problem is non-isothermal, in addition to the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Mass balance equation|mass]] and [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Momentum balance equations|momentum balance equations]], we must also consider the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Energy balance equation|energy balance]].
In this way the system is defined by 5 equations in 5 unknowns ($\mathbf{u}$,p,T). The equations are *coupled* because the physical properties depend on temperature ($\rho$ and $\eta$).

We can make some assumptions without losing the generality of the discussion.
1. *Steady-state conditions*, so no time derivatives.
2. *Negligible viscous dissipation*, in energy balance $\boldsymbol{\sigma} \nabla \textbf{u}=0$
3. *No external forces*, F=0 in momentum balance.
4. *No generation/subtraction of heat in the fluid*, S=0 in energy balance.
5. Low [[Dimentionless numbers/Mach number|Mach number]] (Ma<0.3), $\rho$ depends only on T and not on P.
6. Low T gradient, so $\rho$ is constant and the deviatoric part of the [[Stress tensor|stress tensor]] is zero


The system comprising the Navier-Stokes equations and the energy balance can be rendered dimensionless. This procedure results in the emergence of three adimensional numbers, namely the [[Dimentionless numbers/Reynolds number|Reynolds number]], the [[Dimentionless numbers/Prandl number|Prandl number]], and their product, known as the [[Dimentionless numbers/Peclet number|Peclet number]].

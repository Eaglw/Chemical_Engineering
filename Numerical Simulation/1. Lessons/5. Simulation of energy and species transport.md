If the problem is non-isothermal, in addition to the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Mass balance equation|mass]] and [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Momentum balance equations|momentum balance equations]], we must also consider the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Energy balance equation|energy balance]].
In this way the system is defined by 5 equations in 5 unknowns ($\mathbf{u}$,p,T). The equations are *coupled* because the physical properties depend on temperature ($\rho$ and $\eta$).


With the adimensionalization of the system composed by the Navier-Stockes eq. and the energy balance three adimensional numbers emerges. The Reynolds number, the Peclet number, and the product between these two, the

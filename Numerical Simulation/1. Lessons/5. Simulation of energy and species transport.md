If the problem is non-isothermal, in addition to the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Mass balance equation|mass]] and [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Momentum balance equations|momentum balance equations]], we must also consider the [[Advanced Transport Phenomena/Energy balance equation|energy balance]].
In this way the system is defined by 5 equations in 5 unknowns ($\mathbf{u}$,p,T). The equations are *coupled* because the physical properties depend on temperature.



[[Basic concepts/Boundary conditions|Boundary conditions]]

BC: temperature profile
BC: heat flux
BC: periodicity
BC: fluid-solid coupling
BC: thin-layer

Species transport

BC for species transport

BC: concentration profile
BC: diffusive flux
BC: periodicity
BC: fluid-solid interface
BC: thin-layer

This condition corresponds to an inlet flux normal to the boundary   
where the normal stress is the specified pressure $P_{in}$ and is used when the pressure is known on an inflow boundary of the domain.
It is formally equivalent to the [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary conditions/BC - outflow condition|BC - outflow condition]] with the only different being that now the constant on the right-hand side is the (known) pressure on the inlet boundary.

>$\Large T|_{\Omega_{1}}=T|_{\Omega_{2}}$

The periodicity condition in imposed when a *domain infinitely repeats* (both geometrically and physically) along one direction. The temperature profile must be the same on both the boundaries along the flow.
Similar to the [[Numerical Simulation/2. Boundary conditions/BC - periodicity(flow)|BC - periodicity(flow)]].

This condition imposes a heat flux across a boundary that can be directly a known quantity $q_{BC}$ or it can be assigned through a heat transfer coefficient h.
Physically, a heat transfer coefficient h means a contact of the boundary with an external ambient at temperature $T_{\infty}$. Of course, in this case, the value of h depends on the problem and on the   
wall geometry, and it must be known a priori

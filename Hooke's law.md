>$\LARGE \sigma=E \cdot \epsilon$

![[Helper/media/Hooke's law.png]]

where:
- $\sigma$ is the [[Rheology/Stress|Stress]], defined as $\frac{F}{A}$ in Pa
- E is the *elastic modulus*
- $\epsilon$ is the elongation
This law is applicable only in case of [[Rheology/Elasticity|linear elastic]] materials, where stress is linear with deformation, and the elastic modulus is the slope of the graph.

At the elongation in the direction of the force, is associated a contraption in the other directions, and the magnitude of that contraction can be expressed in function of the elongation thought a constant value $\nu$ called *Poisson's ratio*.
If $\epsilon_{x}=\frac{\sigma_{x}}{E}$, then $\epsilon_{y}=-\nu\frac{\sigma_{x}}{E}$. Common values for the Poisson's ratio $\nu$ are 0,3 for [[Steel|steel]] and 0,25 for many materials. In general $0\leq \nu \geq 0.5$.

The assumption of only one *elastic modulus* and *Poisson's ratio* is valid only for *homogeneous*, *isotropic* materials, otherwise we should consider different values for different directions.

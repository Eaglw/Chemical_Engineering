>$\LARGE \sigma=E \cdot \epsilon$

![[Helper/media/Hooke's law.png]]

where:
- $\sigma$ is the [[Rheology/Stress|Stress]], defined as $\frac{F}{A}$ in Pa
- E is the *elastic modulus*
- $\epsilon$ is the elongation
This law is applicable only in case of [[Rheology/Elasticity|linear elastic]] materials, where stress is linear with deformation, and the elastic modulus is the slope of the graph.

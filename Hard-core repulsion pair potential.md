Colloidal particles have a well-defined size and shape, and solid bodies cannot interpenetrate. That is because of the [[Pauli's exclusion principle|Pauli's exclusion principle]]. It's defined as:
$\LARGE w(r)= + \left( \frac{\sigma}{r}   \right)^{n}$with $\LARGE n \to \infty$   
Given its mathematical nature it's problematic to use for the presence of the infinity in calculations, expecially for computational ones.

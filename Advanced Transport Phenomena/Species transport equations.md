If a fluid is not homogeneous but a mixture, where two or more miscible species flow, mix and eventually react, the time and space evolutino of the mixture composition is governed by a *species transport equation on each species*.
# Mathematical expression
We can express this equation in 4 physically equivalent ways, writing them in terms of mass, moles, mass fraction or mole fraction:
1. [[Mass expression of the species transport equation|Mass expression]]
2. [[Mass fraction expression of the species transport equations|Mass fraction expression]]
3. [[Moles expression of the species transport equations|Moles expression]]
4. [[Molar fraction expression of the species transport equations|Molar fraction expression]]

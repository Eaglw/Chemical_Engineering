To write stochastic differential equations in matlab we need random number generators (RNG) to model the stochastic terms.
Examples can be the Linear Congruential RNG (special case the multiplicative or Lehmer RNG) or Gaussians RNGs, that are particulary useful because the random numbers generated are a gaussian distribution.
Examples of Gaussian RNGs are the Box-Muller method and the Central Limit theorem method.

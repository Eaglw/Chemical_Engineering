The *stress* is related to the force per unit area that a small material element exerts by contact on its surroundings. A simple example is the pressure in a stagnant liquid, where such a force is the same in all direction (isotropy). More complex is the situation arising when the material is deformed, and the stress becomes anisotropic. Typical unit is Pa (Pascal = $\frac{N}{m^2}$).

Shear viscosity is a measure of how easily a fluid flows when it is subjected to a force that causes it to flow in one direction while another force pushes against it in a perpendicular direction. It is typically measured in units of Pa·s (Pascal-seconds) or Stokes (1/10th of a Poiseuille). A higher shear viscosity means that the fluid will be thicker and more resistant to flow, while a lower shear viscosity means that the fluid will be thinner and easier to flow.️

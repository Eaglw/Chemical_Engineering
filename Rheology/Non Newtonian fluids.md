A fluid is non Newtonian if it shows any of the following behavior:
1. The [[Shear viscosity|shear viscosity]] vary with the [[Shear rate|shear rate]].
2. It presents [[Normal stresses|normal stresses]] in simple shear flow. 
3. It shows [[Rheopexicity|rheopexic]] or [[Thixotropy|thixotropic]] behavior, viscosity depends on time.
4. [[Shear viscosity|Shear viscosity]] and [[Elongational viscosity|elongational viscosity]] are not in simple proportion, like the [[Trouton ratio|Trouton ratio]].

The first point is the most common way to describe a non Newtonian fluid, but there are some fluid classes like [[Yield fluids|Yield fluids]] that has a constant viscosity but are non Newtonian, so it's not enough to classify all kind of fluids.

The *strain rate* is the [[Rheology/Strain|strain]] achieved per unit time. Dimension is inverse time, typically $\frac{1}{s}$. It is related to the [[Velocity gradient tensor|velocity gradient]] of the flow.

The most common strain rate are the *shear rate* and the *elongation rate*, in the case of shear and elongational flow.

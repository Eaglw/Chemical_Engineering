>The *strain* measures the change in shape of a small material element. It's a *non-dimensional quantity*, because it's a *ratio* of the length after and before the deformation. 

The most common deformations (strain) are shear and elongational deformations, because almost all deformations can be decomposed in the sum of these two.

Th
There are many other different ways to measure strains, 

- *Stretch ratio* $s=\frac{l}{l_{0}}$
- *Engineering (Cauchy) strain (for small strains)* $\epsilon_{E}=\frac{l-l_{0}}{l_{0}}$
- *Hencky strain* $\epsilon_{E}=$

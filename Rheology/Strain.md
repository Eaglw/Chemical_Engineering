>The *strain* measures the change in shape of a small material element. It's a *non-dimensional quantity*, because it's a *ratio* of the length after and before the deformation. 

The most common deformations (strain) are shear and elongational deformations, because almost all deformations can be decomposed in the sum of these two.
## Shear strain
$\gamma=\frac{d}{h}$
## Elongational strain
- *Stretch ratio* $s=\frac{l}{l_{0}}$
- *Engineering (Cauchy) strain (for small strains)* $\epsilon_{E}=\frac{l-l_{0}}{l_{0}}$
- *Hencky strain* $\epsilon_{H}=\log \frac{l}{l_{0}}$
- *Green Lagrange strain* $\epsilon_{C}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{l^{2}-l^{2}_{0}}{l^{2}_{0}}$

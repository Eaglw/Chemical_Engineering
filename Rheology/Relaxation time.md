The time it takes to a material to relax the stress caused by a deformation.

In reality, the accumulated stress exponentially decreases and the material relaxes, but never reaches zero. By definition, the relaxation time is the time needed for stress to reach a value of 1/e (e ≈ 2.71828, 1/e ≈ 0.368) times of the initial stress.

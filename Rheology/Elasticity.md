Elasticity is the physical property of a material when it deforms under [[Rheology/Stress|stresses]](external forces), but returns to its original shape when the stress is removed.

The property of materials known as elasticity refers to the ability of a material to regain its original shape after being deformed or stretched. This is often characterized by the material's capacity to return to its original dimensions and configuration following the removal of an external force that caused the deformation.

In a more technical sense, elasticity is defined as the ratio of stress (force per unit area) to strain (deformation per unit length). Materials that exhibit high elasticity tend to have a high modulus of elasticity, which is a measure of their ability to resist deformation under stress. Conversely, materials with low elasticity tend to have a lower modulus of elasticity and may be more prone to permanent deformation or plasticity.

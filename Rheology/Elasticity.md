The property of materials known as *elasticity* refers to the ability of a material to regain its original shape after being deformed or stretched.
The *modulus of elasticity* is defined as the ratio of [[Rheology/Stress|stress]] to [[Rheology/Strain|strain]].

where:
- (a) is a *linear elastic* behaviour
- (b) is a *non-linear elastic* behaviour
- (c) is a *non-elastic* or *plastic-elastic* behaviour

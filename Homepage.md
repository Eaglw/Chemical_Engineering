Hi, i'm Daniele, a chemical engineering student based in Naples, and this is our wiki!
I've always struggled to find a way to link all the informations that we learn everyday, covered by many courses in different way. Finally I've made some progress and I'll be happy to share it with everyone.
Not all the courses are covered at the moment, nor they will be in future.

The name comes from the fact that the potential is defined from a pair of molecules/particles. The force between the 2 particles can be defined from the [[Gradient|gradient]] of the potential energy.
$\LARGE F=- \frac{\partial w(r)}{\partial r}$ 
Let's analize some common elements of the pair potentials of different natures starting from the [[Lennar Jones pair potential|Lennar Jones pair potential]].
